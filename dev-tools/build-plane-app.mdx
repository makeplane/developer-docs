sidebarTitle: Build a Plane app
description: Step-by-step development guide to build and integrate an app with Plane using OAuth-based authentication and authorization workflow.
---

<Note>Plane apps are currently in **Beta**. Please send any feedback to support@plane.so.</Note>

## Introduction
Plane apps seamlessly integrate tools and services with Plane so you can
use them without ever leaving your Workspace. Apps are conveniently available
from our [marketplace](https://plane.so/marketplace/integrations), helping you
stay focused and productive.

## Why Build a Plane App?

**Stop doing manual work.**
Plane integrations eliminate repetitive tasks like copying updates between
tools, creating work items from support tickets, and generating status reports.
Instead of spending hours on administrative work, let your app handle it
automatically.

**Connect everything you already use.**
Your team probably uses dozens of different tools. Plane apps create a unified
workflow by connecting your favorite CRM, time tracking app, CI/CD pipelines,
communication tools, and more, together into Plane. One change in Plane can
trigger updates across your entire tech stack.

**Build exactly what you need.**
Unlike rigid SaaS platforms, Plane's open core nature means you can create
integrations that fit your specific workflow.

## Prerequisites

- A [Plane](https://app.plane.so) workspace
- Admin access to your workspace settings
- Familiarity with OAuth 2.0 concepts (authorization code flow)
- A backend server to handle OAuth token exchange

## High-Level Workflow

1. [Register your app on Plane developer portal](/api-reference/byoa/build-plane-app/#registering-your-app)
2. [Implement OAuth flow](/api-reference/byoa/build-plane-app#implement-oauth-flow)
3. [Obtain and store access tokens securely](/api-reference/byoa/build-plane-app#obtain-and-store-access-tokens-securely)
4. [Make authenticated API requests to Plane](/api-reference/byoa/build-plane-app#make-authenticated-api-requests-to-plane)
5. [Handle token refresh](/api-reference/byoa/build-plane-app#handle-token-refresh)

## Registering Your App

To build an OAuth application with Plane:

1. Navigate to `https://app.plane.so/<workspace_slug>/settings/integrations/`.
2. Click on the **Build your own** button.
3. Fill out the form with the required details:

   - **Setup URL**: Provide the URL that users will be redirected to when they click "Install" from the marketplace or from the app listing. This URL should initiate the OAuth flow for your application.
   - **Redirect URIs**: Provide the URIs where Plane will send the authorization code after the user consents to the app.
   - **Webhook URL Endpoint(Optional)**: Your service's webhook endpoint. Plane will send an HTTP `POST` request to this endpoint upon every change to the workspace in which your app was installed.
   - **Contact Details**: Add your email or other contact information.
   - **Organization Details(Optional)**: Optionally include your contact email, privacy policy URL, terms of service URL, and any other relevant information. This helps Plane validate and approve your application should you choose to [list in the marketplace](#listing-your-app-on-plane-marketplace).

4. If you're building an agent (with or without using Plane's ADK) capable of performing operations when assigned or mentioned, enable the **Enable App Mentions** checkbox during app creation.
5. Once the app is created, securely store the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You will need these credentials to interact with Plane's API during the OAuth flow and for making authenticated API requests.

## Implement OAuth Flow

### Generating Consent URL (Optional)

This step is optional. This is needed only if the app should be installed from outside Plane's environment, the developer needs to generate the consent URL using the client ID generated during their app creation flow.

If this flow needs to be triggered from Plane marketplace as well, then provide the URL in "Setup URL" field on application create screen to redirect the user from marketplace on clicking "Install App" button.

Below are sample implementations:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
import os
from urllib.parse import urlencode

params = {
    "client_id": os.getenv("PLANE_CLIENT_ID"),
    "response_type": "code",
    "redirect_uri": os.getenv("PLANE_REDIRECT_URI"),
    # Optional: include state if needed
}

consent_url = f"https://api.plane.so/auth/o/authorize-app/?{urlencode(params)}"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { URLSearchParams } from 'url';

const params = new URLSearchParams({
  client_id: process.env.PLANE_CLIENT_ID!,
  response_type: "code",
  redirect_uri: process.env.PLANE_REDIRECT_URI!,
  // Optional: include state if needed
});

const consentUrl = `https://api.plane.so/auth/o/authorize-app/?${params.toString()}`;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

There are two types of authenticated actions your application can perform:

1. **User-authorized actions**: Actions performed on behalf of a user after they grant permission to your app via OAuth.
2. **App-authorized actions**: Actions that the app can perform independently within the workspace where it is installed (such as responding to webhooks or automation triggers).

For both these flows, Plane will make a GET request to the Redirect URI with parameters as mentioned in the following sections.

We will describe how to configure and use each type in the following sections.

### App-Authorized Actions (Client Credentials Flow)

When the app is installed, Plane will send both a `code` and an `app_installation_id` as part of the callback to the Redirect URI provided during consent URL generation. You can use this `app_installation_id` to request a bot token for your app.

Plane will make a GET request to the Redirect URI with below parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| code | Authorization code (present but not used for client credentials flow) |
| app_installation_id | The unique identifier for the app installation in the workspace |

#### Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
import os
import time
from plane.oauth.api import OAuthApi
from plane.oauth.models import OAuthConfig

# Initialize OAuth API
def get_oauth_api():
    oauth_config = OAuthConfig(
        client_id=os.getenv("PLANE_CLIENT_ID"),
        client_secret=os.getenv("PLANE_CLIENT_SECRET"),
        redirect_uri=os.getenv("PLANE_REDIRECT_URI"),
    )
    return OAuthApi(
        oauth_config=oauth_config,
        base_url=os.getenv("PLANE_BASE_URL", "https://api.plane.so"),
    )

# Get bot token using app installation ID
oauth_api = get_oauth_api()
token_response = oauth_api.get_bot_token(app_installation_id)

# Get app installation details
app_installations = oauth_api.get_app_installations(
    token_response.access_token,
    app_installation_id,
)

if not app_installations:
    raise Exception(f"No app installations found for app installation ID {app_installation_id}")

app_installation = app_installations[0]
bot_token = token_response.access_token
expires_in = token_response.expires_in
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

// Prepare basic auth header using client_id and client_secret
const clientId = "your_client_id";
const clientSecret = "your_client_secret";
const basicAuth = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString('base64');

// Prepare request data
const payload = {
  grant_type: "client_credentials",
  app_installation_id: appInstallationId
};

// Make a POST request to fetch bot token
const response = await axios.post(
  "https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
  payload,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Basic ${basicAuth}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
  }
);

// Parse the response
const responseData = response.data;
const botToken = responseData.access_token;
const expiresIn = responseData.expires_in; // Token expiry in seconds
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### User-Authorized Actions (Authorization Code Flow)

In this flow, your app exchanges the `code` received as a query parameter on the callback (to your Redirect URI) for an access token and refresh token. The access token is short-lived and must be refreshed using the refresh token when it expires. Both tokens should be securely stored.

Plane will make a GET request to the Redirect URI with below parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| code | The authorization code that can be exchanged for an access token | Yes |
| state | The state parameter that was passed in the authorization request | No |


#### Examples

<Tab title="Python">

```python
from plane.oauth.api import OAuthApi
from plane.oauth.models import OAuthConfig

# Initialize OAuth API
oauth_api = get_oauth_api()  # Using the helper function from above

# Exchange authorization code for access and refresh tokens
code = "authorization_code_from_callback"
token_response = oauth_api.exchange_code_for_token(
    code,
    "authorization_code",
)

# Parse the response
access_token = token_response.access_token
refresh_token = token_response.refresh_token
expires_in = token_response.expires_in

const redirectUri = "your_redirect_uri";

const payload = {
  grant_type: "authorization_code",
  code: code,
  client_id: clientId,
  client_secret: clientSecret,
  redirect_uri: redirectUri
};

const response = await axios.post(
  "https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
  payload,
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

);

// Parse the response
const responseData = response.data;
const accessToken = responseData.access_token;
const refreshToken = responseData.refresh_token;
const expiresIn = responseData.expires_in;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Fetching App Installation Details

In both user-authorized and app-authorized flows, the `app_installation_id` identifies the app's installation within a specific workspace. It is recommended that developers fetch workspace details after OAuth is successfully completed. Plane provides an `app-installation` endpoint that works with both types of tokens.

#### Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
# Using the OAuth API to fetch app installation details
oauth_api = get_oauth_api()
app_installations = oauth_api.get_app_installations(
    token,  # Either access token or bot token
    app_installation_id,
)

if app_installations:
    workspace_details = app_installations[0]
    print(f"Workspace: {workspace_details.workspace_detail.name}")
    print(f"Workspace Slug: {workspace_details.workspace_detail.slug}")
    print(f"Bot User ID: {workspace_details.app_bot}")
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

// Set authorization header with either access token or bot token
const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
};

// Make GET request to fetch installation/workspace details
const response = await axios.get(
  `https://api.plane.so/auth/o/app-installation/?id=${app_installation_id}`,
  { headers }
);

const workspaceDetails = response.data[0];
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Sample Response

The app installation endpoint returns an **array** of installation objects. Typically, you'll want to use the first element `[0]`:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "34b97361-8636-43dc-953e-90deedc8498f",
        "workspace_detail": {
            "name": "sandbox",
            "slug": "sandbox",
            "id": "7a2e5944-c117-4a7d-b5f4-058fe705d7d1",
            "logo_url": null
        },
        "created_at": "2025-05-16T13:50:27.865821Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-06-23T08:57:26.976742Z",
        "deleted_at": null,
        "status": "installed",
        "workspace": "7a2e5944-c117-4a7d-b5f4-058fe705d7d1",
        "application": "ab235529-388a-4f51-a55a-78272251f5f1",
        "installed_by": "63333ab1-c605-42fc-82f7-5cd86799eca1",
        "app_bot": "7286aaa7-9250-4851-a520-29c904fd7654", // Bot user ID for your app in this workspace
        "webhook": "b1f4b7f1-51e8-4919-a84c-0b1143b51d2c"
    }
]
```

**Key fields to note:**
- `app_bot`: The bot user ID that represents your app in the workspace
- `workspace_detail.slug`: The workspace slug needed for API calls
- `workspace`: The workspace ID for identifying the workspace
- `status`: Should be "installed" for active installations

## Webhook Payload Structure

When Plane sends webhooks to your application, the payload contains information about the event that occurred. Understanding this structure is crucial for processing webhooks effectively.

### General Webhook Structure

All webhooks follow this general structure:

```json
{
  "event": "string",           // Type of event (e.g., "issue", "issue_comment", "project")
  "action": "string",          // Action performed (e.g., "created", "updated", "deleted")
  "webhook_id": "string",      // Unique identifier for the webhook
  "workspace_id": "string",    // ID of the workspace where the event occurred
  "data": {                    // Event-specific data (varies by event type)
    "id": "string",
    // ... other fields specific to the event
  },
  "activity": {                // Information about who performed the action
    "actor": {
      "id": "string",
      "first_name": "string",
      "last_name": "string",
      "email": "string",
      "avatar": "string",
      "display_name": "string"
    },
    "field": "string",         // Field that was changed (for update events)
    "new_value": "any",        // New value (for update events)
    "old_value": "any"         // Previous value (for update events)
  }
}
```

### Common Event Types

#### Issue Comment Events

When someone comments on an issue:

```json
{
  "event": "issue_comment",
  "action": "created",
  "webhook_id": "uuid",
  "workspace_id": "uuid",
  "data": {
    "id": "comment_id",
    "issue": "issue_id",
    "project": "project_id",
    "workspace": "workspace_id",
    "comment_html": "<p>Full HTML comment content</p>",
    "comment_stripped": "Plain text comment content",
    "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "activity": {
    "actor": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "display_name": "User Name",
      "email": "user@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Issue Events

When an issue is created, updated, or deleted:

```json
{
  "event": "issue",
  "action": "updated",
  "webhook_id": "uuid",
  "workspace_id": "uuid",
  "data": {
    "id": "issue_id",
    "name": "Issue Title",
    "description_html": "<p>Issue description</p>",
    "priority": "high",
    "project": "project_id",
    "workspace": "workspace_id",
    "assignees": ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"],
    "labels": ["label_id_1"],
    "state": {
      "id": "state_id",
      "name": "In Progress",
      "color": "#f39c12"
    },
    "created_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "activity": {
    "actor": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "display_name": "User Name"
    },
    "field": "priority",
    "new_value": "high",
    "old_value": "medium"
  }
}
```

### Processing Webhooks

Here's how to process webhooks in your application:

<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
interface WebhookPayload {
  event: string;
  action: string;
  webhook_id: string;
  workspace_id: string;
  data: any;

      id: string;
      display_name: string;
      email?: string;
    };
    field?: string;
    new_value?: any;
    old_value?: any;
  };
}

// Process incoming webhook
async function handleWebhook(payload: WebhookPayload) {
  console.log(`Received ${payload.event} ${payload.action} event`);
  
  // Get workspace credentials
  const credentials = await getCredentialsForWorkspace(payload.workspace_id);
  if (!credentials) {
    throw new Error(`No credentials found for workspace ${payload.workspace_id}`);
  }
  
  // Process specific event types
  if (payload.event === 'issue_comment' && payload.action === 'created') {
    const comment = payload.data.comment_stripped;
    if (comment.includes('/your-command')) {
      // Handle your custom command
      await processCommand(payload.data, credentials);
    }
  }

        webhook = WebhookEvent(**payload_data)
        print(f"Received {webhook.event} {webhook.action} event")
        
        # Get workspace credentials (implement your own storage)
        credentials = get_credentials_for_workspace(webhook.workspace_id)

## Obtain and store access tokens securely

Once you have obtained the access token, you can use it to make authenticated API requests to Plane.
Store the access token and refresh token securely in your database.


## Make authenticated API requests to Plane

For making authenticated API requests to Plane, you can use the access token obtained from the OAuth flow.

API reference is available at [https://docs.plane.so/api-reference](https://docs.plane.so/api-reference).

We have official SDKs for the following languages to simplify the OAuth flow and make it easier to call Plane's API.

| Language | Package Link | Source Code |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Node.js | [npm i @makeplane/plane-node-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@makeplane/plane-node-sdk) | [plane-node-sdk](https://github.com/makeplane/plane-node-sdk) |
| Python | [pip install plane-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/plane-sdk/) | [plane-python-sdk](https://github.com/makeplane/plane-python-sdk) |

## Handle Token Refresh

Token refresh works differently depending on the type of token you're using:

### Bot Token Refresh (Client Credentials Flow)

Bot tokens obtained through the client credentials flow don't use refresh tokens. Instead, when a bot token expires, you simply request a new one using the same `app_installation_id`:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
# When bot token expires, request a new one using the same app_installation_id
from plane.oauth.api import OAuthApi

def refresh_bot_token(app_installation_id: str):
    """Refresh an expired bot token"""
    oauth_api = get_oauth_api()  # Using helper function from earlier examples
    
    # Get new bot token using the same app_installation_id
    token_response = oauth_api.get_bot_token(app_installation_id)
    
    # Store the new token securely in your database
    new_bot_token = token_response.access_token
    expires_in = token_response.expires_in
    
    return new_bot_token, expires_in

# Usage example
new_token, expires_in = refresh_bot_token(app_installation_id)
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
// When bot token expires, request a new one using the same app_installation_id
import axios from 'axios';

const clientId = "your_client_id";
const clientSecret = "your_client_secret";
const basicAuth = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString('base64');

const payload = {
  grant_type: "client_credentials",
  app_installation_id: appInstallationId  // Same ID used during initial setup
};

const response = await axios.post(
  "https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
  payload,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Basic ${basicAuth}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
  }
);

// Parse the response
const responseData = response.data;
const newBotToken = responseData.access_token;
const expiresIn = responseData.expires_in;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### User Token Refresh (Authorization Code Flow)

When user access tokens expire, you can use the refresh token to get a new access token:


#### Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
# When access token expires, use refresh token to get a new access token
from plane.oauth.api import OAuthApi

def refresh_user_token(refresh_token: str):
    """Refresh an expired user access token"""
    oauth_api = get_oauth_api()  # Using helper function from earlier examples
    
    # Use refresh token to get new access token
    token_response = oauth_api.exchange_code_for_token(
        refresh_token,
        "refresh_token",
    )
    
    # Store the new tokens securely
    new_access_token = token_response.access_token
    new_refresh_token = token_response.refresh_token  # May be the same or new
    expires_in = token_response.expires_in
    
    return new_access_token, new_refresh_token, expires_in

# Usage example
new_access_token, new_refresh_token, expires_in = refresh_user_token(stored_refresh_token)
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
// When access token expires, use refresh token to get a new access token
const refreshPayload = {
  grant_type: "refresh_token",
  refresh_token: refreshToken,
  client_id: clientId,
  client_secret: clientSecret
};

const refreshResponse = await axios.post(
  "https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
  refreshPayload,
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
  }
);

// Parse the refresh response
const refreshResponseData = refreshResponse.data;
const accessToken = refreshResponseData.access_token;
```
