:::info
The Plane cloud API is available at `https://api.plane.so/`
:::

## Quick start

### 1. Get your API key

To make requests to the Plane API, you'll need an API key.  This key is used to
verify your client's identity and permissions.  The key must be passed as the
value of the `X-API-Key` header.

Enough talk. Let's get you an API key!

:::tip
You must have a Plane account or be registered to your instance to generate a key.
:::

1. Log into your Plane account and go to **Profile Settings**
  ![Profile Settings](/images/api-reference/profile-settings.png#center)
2. Go to **Personal Access Tokens**
  ![API Tokens](/images/api-reference/api-tokens-plane.png#center)
3. Click **Add personal access token**
  ![Add API key](/images/api-reference/add-api-key-plane.png#center)
4. Enter a title and description to help you remember why you created this key
5. Optionally set an expiry date for the key, after which time the key will no longer be valid

:::danger
Treat your API key like a password. Keep it secret. Keep it safe. It is
important to store your API key securely and keep it confidential to prevent
unauthorized access to your account. Do not share it or expose it in
client-side code.
:::

### 2. Execute an HTTP request ðŸ”„

When issuing HTTP requests to the API, you'll always set the `x-api-key`
request header to your API key.  For example, if using `curl` this looks like:

```bash
curl -L 'https://api.plane.so/api/v1/workspaces/:slug/projects/:project_id/issues/' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-H 'X-API-Key: <X-API-Key>'
```

Run the above command to receive your first response from the Plane API.

### 3. Congratulations ðŸ¥³

Congratulations! You've successfully run your first HTTP request using the
[Plane](https://plane.so) API. Next, browse the rest of our documentation for
more examples of how you can integrate your project! ðŸ˜Ž

## General API usage

### Base URL

All requests to the Plane Cloud API must be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.plane.so/
```

:::info
If you're using a self-hosted instance of Plane, your API base URL will differ based on your custom domain and setup.
:::

### Security recommendations

- **Keep the API Key Secret**: Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it or expose it in client-side code.
- **Regenerate Key If Compromised**: If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, generate a new one immediately and update your applications.

### API key errors

- If the **`X-API-Key`** header is not included, the API will return an error indicating that authentication is required.
- If the provided API key is invalid or expired, the API will return an error message indicating an authentication failure.

### HTTP methods

HTTP defines a set of request methods, also known as HTTP verbs, to indicate the desired action for a given resource.

Given below is the list of methods commonly adopted byÂ Plane'sÂ API:

|Verb  |Description                                        |Example                            |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|GET   |Requests a representation of the specified resource|Fetch all work items from a project|
|POST  |Submits an entity to the specified resource        |Create a project                   |
|DELETE|Deletes the specified resource                     |Delete a work item                 |
|PATCH |Applies partial modifications to a resource        |Edit a module                      |

### Status codes

Given below is the list of the most commonly encountered success responses:

| Status Code    | Description                                                                            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 OK         | The request succeeded. Generally used in GET or PATCH requests.     |
| 201 Created    | The request succeeded and a new resource was created. Generally used in POST requests. |
| 204 No Content | The request succeeded and no body is returned. Generally used in DELETE requests.      |

### Error responses

Given below is the list of the most commonly encountered error responses:

| Status Code               | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400 Bad Request           | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.                                                                            |
| 401 Unauthorized          | Although the HTTP standard specifies "unauthorized", semantically, this response means "unauthenticated". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. |
| 404 Not Found             | The server cannot find the requested resource. This means the URL is not recognized.                                                                                                  |
| 429 Throttling Error      | The server has received too many requests from your client within a short period of time. Retry the request later. You can read more in our [rate-limiting](#rate-limiting) section.                  |
| 500 Internal Server Error | The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle, and failed to process the request.                                                                                                                |
| 502 Bad Gateway           | The server received an invalid response from another service which was required to handle the request.                                          |
| 503 Service Unavailable   | The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or overloaded.                                                              |
| 504 Gateway Timeout       | The server was unable to receive a timely response from a downstream service.

## Pagination

The Plane API implements a cursor-based pagination system, allowing clients to
efficiently navigate through large datasets. The system uses a cursor parameter
to manage the position and direction of pagination.

### Querystring parameters

Paging is controlled by clients via the following querystring parameters.

- **`per_page` (optional)**: Number of items to display per page. Defaults to 100. The maximum allowed value is 100.
- **`cursor` (optional)**: Cursor string (see below) to navigate to a specific page. If not provided, pagination starts from the first page.

### Cursor string format

The cursor string is formatted as **`value:offset:is_prev`**, where:

- **`value`** represents the page size (number of items per page)
- **`offset`** is the current page number (starting from 0)
- **`is_prev`** indicates whether the cursor is moving to the previous page (**`1`**) or to the next page (**`0`**)

### Example: Fetching the first page

```
GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace-slug/projects/:project_id/issues/?per_page=20
```

#### Pagination response

The paginated response includes the following fields:

- **`next_cursor`**: Cursor string for the next page
- **`prev_cursor`**: Cursor string for the previous page
- **`next_page_results`**: Boolean indicating if there are more results after the current page
- **`prev_page_results`**: Boolean indicating if there are results before the current page
- **`count`**: Total number of items on the current page
- **`total_pages`**: Estimated total number of pages
- **`total_results`**: Total number of items across all pages
- **`extra_stats`**: Additional statistics, if any
- **`results`**: Array of items for the current page

Here's an example response for the first page of results:

```json
{
  "next_cursor": "20:1:0",
  "prev_cursor": "",
  "next_page_results": true,
  "prev_page_results": false,
  "count": 20,
  "total_pages": 50,
  "total_results": 1000,
  "extra_stats": {},
  "results": [ ... items ... ]
}
```

### Example: Fetching the next page

```
GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace-slug/projects/:project_id/issues?per_page=20&cursor=20:1:0
```

#### Pagination next page response

```json
{
  "next_cursor": "20:2:0",
  "prev_cursor": "20:0:1",
  "next_page_results": true,
  "prev_page_results": true,
  "count": 20,
  "total_pages": 50,
  "total_results": 1000,
  "extra_stats": {},
  "results": [ ... items ... ]
}
```

### Pagination errors

- **Invalid Cursor Format**: If the provided cursor string is not in the correct format, the API will respond with an error message indicating an invalid cursor format.
- **Pagination Limits**: Requests exceeding the maximum **`per_page`** limit will receive an error response detailing the maximum allowed value.

---

## Rate limiting

To ensure fair usage and maintain the overall quality of service for the
community, the Plane API implements rate limiting. Rate limiting restricts the
number of requests a client can make within a certain time frame.

### Rate limit details

- **Limit**: Each client is limited to 60 requests per minute
- **Reset Interval**: The rate limit counter resets every minute
- **Scope of Limitation**: The rate limit applies to all requests made with a given API key

### Identifying your rate limit status

Your current rate limit status is communicated in the response headers of each API request:

- **`X-RateLimit-Remaining`**: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window
- **`X-RateLimit-Reset`**: The time at which the current rate limit window resets (in UTC epoch seconds)

```
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1700327957
```

## Fine tuning response fields

The Plane API provides flexible data retrieval capabilities through two powerful query
parameters: `fields` and `expand`. These parameters allow clients to tailor the
response data to their specific needs, optimizing both the payload size and the
clarity of the response.

### Fields parameter

The `fields` parameter enables clients to selectively retrieve only a subset of
fields for a given resource.

:::tip
The `fields` parameter is particularly useful for reducing response time, size
and bandwidth, especially when your client requires only specific pieces of data.
:::

The **`fields`** parameter accepts a comma-separated list of field names that
the client wants to be included in the response. For example, to include only
the `id`, `name`, and `description` fields, send the following querystring parameters:

```
GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace-slug/projects/:project_id/issues/?fields=id,name,description
```

#### Fields parameter error handling

Invalid or unrecognized field names passed in the **`fields`** parameter will
result in an error response, indicating which fields are invalid.

### Expand parameter

The `expand` parameter allows clients to request additional related information to
be included in the response. This is useful for retrieving detailed information
about nested resources without making separate API calls.

For example, to return the resource data along with expanded information about
the `assignees` and `state`, send the following querystring parameters:

```
GET /api/v1/workspaces/:workspace-slug/projects/:project_id/issues/?expand=assignees,state
```

#### Expand parameter error handling

If **`expand`** is used on fields that cannot be expanded, an appropriate error message will be returned.
