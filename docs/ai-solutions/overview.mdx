## Introduction

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview) (MCP) is a
standardized interface that enables AI models to communicate with external tools and
services. When combined with Server-Sent Events (SSE), it provides a powerful
mechanism for real-time data transfer between AI models and external systems.

:::tip Alpha
The Plane MCP Server is currently in **Alpha**. Some aspects of the API may change.
While MCP is standardized, it is also rapidly evolving. The Plane MCP Server aims to
provide a stable implementation for developers to build robust AI-powered
applications. Please send feedback to engineering@plane.so.

## Using the Plane MCP Server

Follow these steps to integrate with the Plane MCP Server.

### Claude.ai

- Open **Settings** from the sidebar on the web or desktop app.
- Scroll to the **Integrations** section and click **Add more**.
- Enter the Integration URL: `https://mcp.plane.so/sse`
- Click **Connect** to link your Plane workspace.

### Claude Desktop

Add Plane to [Claude Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) by
updating your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VSCode

Connect Plane to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server)
by editing your `.vscode.json` or `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "plane": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you encounter issues with Plane Auth, run the following command in your terminal to
remove stale auth tokens, then restart the server. MCP Remote servers are still
experimental.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth/mcp-remote-*
```

## Activating the Plane MCP Server

After setup, when activating the server, you will be prompted in your browser to
connect your Plane workspace to the MCP server.

When prompted to authorize, click **Approve**.

Next, choose the workspace you want to connect, review the permissions, and click
**Accept**.

## Congrats!

You have successfully connected your Plane workspace to the MCP server!
