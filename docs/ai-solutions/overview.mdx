## Introduction

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview) (MCP) is
a standardized interface that enables AI models to communicate with external
tools and services. When combined with Server-Sent Events (SSE), it provides a
powerful mechanism for real-time data transfer between AI models and external
systems.

:::tip Alpha
The Plane MCP Server is currently in **Alpha**. Some aspects of the API may change.
While MCP is standardized, it is also rapidly evolving. The Plane MCP Server
aims to provide a stable implementation that can be used by developers to build
robust applications that leverage the power of AI.
Please send feedback to engineering@plane.so.

## Using the Plane MCP Server

Follow the steps below to integrate with the Plane MCP Server.

### Claude.ai

- Open **Settings** from the sidebar on the web or desktop app.
- Scroll down to the **Integrations** section and click **Add more**.
- Enter the following Integration URL: `https://mcp.plane.so/sse`
- Click **Connect** to link your Plane workspace.

### Claude Desktop

You can add Plane to [Claude
Desktop](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) by updating your
`claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plane": {
       "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VSCode

You can also connect Plane to
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server)
by editing your `.vscode.json` or `mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "plane": {
       "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.plane.so/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you face any issues with Plane Auth, please run the command below in the
terminal to remove stale auth tokens. Then, restart the server. MCP Remote
servers are still experimental.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth/mcp-remote-*
```

## Activating the Plane MCP Server

After following the above steps, when activating the server, you will be
prompted via your browser to connect your Plane workspace to the MCP server.

When prompted to authorize, click "**Approve**".

import Approve from '@site/static/images/mcp/approve.png';

<img style={{width: '600px'}} src={Approve} alt="authorization" />

<br/>
<br/>
Next, choose the workspace to which you want to connect, review the permissions
and click "**Accept**".

import Accept from '@site/static/images/mcp/accept.png';

<img style={{width: '600px'}} src={Accept} alt="accept" />

## Congrats!

You have successfully connected your Plane workspace to the MCP server!
