# Self-host, integrate, and extend Plane

Welcome to Plane's developer documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to deploy, customize, integrate, and extend Plane's capabilities for your organization.

## What's in here

import { Card } from '@site/src/components/Card';
import { CardGroup } from '@site/src/components/CardGroup';

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Self-Hosting" icon="FaServer" href="/self-hosting/overview">
    Deploy Plane on your own infrastructure with full control over your data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Reference" icon="FaCode" href="/api/introduction">
    Complete documentation of our REST API.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Webhooks" icon="FaBolt" href="/webhooks/overview">
    Set up real-time notifications so your other systems know when stuff happens in Plane.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Where to start
Not sure where to begin? Here's what we'd suggest:

If you're setting up Plane for the first time, start with the self-hosting section. We'll get you up and running.

If you're connecting Plane to something else, jump to the API reference. Get familiar with how our data is structured and try a few calls.

## When you get stuck
Things break, documentation isn't perfect, and sometimes you just need to talk to a human. 
Reach out on Discord - our community is pretty helpful and we're usually around to answer questions.
