## Introduction

With Plane Apps, you seamlessly integrate your tools and services with
Plane, allowing you to use them without ever leaving your Plane Workspace. You
can either build your own or simply install existing Apps directly from our
[marketplace](https://plane.so/marketplace/integrations), helping you stay
focused and productive.

:::tip Beta
Plane Apps are currently in **Beta**. Some aspects of the API may change. Please
send feedback to support@plane.so.

## Why Build a Plane App?

### Stop doing manual work

Plane integrations eliminate repetitive tasks like copying updates between
tools, creating work items from support tickets, and generating status reports.
Instead of spending hours on administrative work, let your Plane App handle it
automatically.

### Connect everything you already use

Your team probably uses dozens of different tools. Plane Apps create a unified
workflow by connecting your favorite CRM, time tracking apps, CI/CD pipelines,
communication tools, and anything else you can imagine, together into Plane. One
change in Plane triggerring updates across your entire tech stack.

### Build exactly what you need

Unlike rigid SaaS platforms, Plane's [open core nature](https://plane.so/open-source) means you can create
integrations that fit your specific workflow.
