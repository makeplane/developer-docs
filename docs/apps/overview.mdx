## Why Build a Plane App?

### Eliminate Manual Work

Plane integrations eliminate repetitive tasks like copying updates between tools,
creating work items from support tickets, and generating status reports. Let your
Plane App handle these tasks automatically.

### Connect Everything You Use

Your team likely uses many tools. Plane Apps create a unified workflow by connecting
your favorite CRM, time tracking apps, CI/CD pipelines, communication tools, and
more. One change in Plane can trigger updates across your tech stack.

### Build Exactly What You Need

Plane's [open core nature](https://plane.so/open-source) means you can create
integrations that fit your specific workflow.
