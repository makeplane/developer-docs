## Introduction

Webhooks are a powerful way to receive real-time HTTP-based notifications about
events in Plane. By setting up a webhook, you can automatically receive updates
whenever specific events occur, such as the creation, update, or deletion of
projects, work items, or other entities.

:::tip Events
Plane supports the following webhook events:

- **Project**: created, updated, deleted
- **Cycle**: created, updated, deleted
- **Module**: created, updated, deleted
- **Work Item**: created, updated, deleted, added to cycle, added to module
- **Work Item Comment**: created, updated, deleted
:::


## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook, navigate to your Plane workspace settings, **Developer**
section, and click **Webhooks**. Then click the **Add webhook** button.

import ImgCreate from '@site/static/images/webhooks/create.png';

<img src={ImgCreate} className='center' style={{width: '700px'}} alt="Create webhook" />

Next, enter your URL, optionally choose the events which will trigger
your webhook and click **Create**.

import ImgDetails from '@site/static/images/webhooks/details.png';

<img src={ImgDetails} className='center' style={{width: '700px'}} alt="Define webhook details" />

Afterwards, you will be prompted to save your webhook secret key. You can use
this key to verify the authenticity of webhook payloads you receive from Plane.
We'll cover this [later in the guide](#verifying-payloads).

import ImgKey from '@site/static/images/webhooks/key.png';

<img src={ImgKey} className='center' style={{width: '700px'}} alt="Webhook key created" />

## Defining a webhook consumer

Your webhook consumer URL must be an HTTP endpoint which satisfies the following conditions:

1. Responds to Plane requests with an `HTTP 200` ("OK") response
2. Is publicly accessible
3. Is not localhost
    - Valid: `https://example.com/webhook`
    - Invalid: `http://localhost:3000/webhook`

:::tip
If your consumer does not respond with an `HTTP 200` response, Plane will retry the delivery
up to three times with an exponential backoff delay.

## Webhook payloads

When a webhook is triggered, Plane sends a JSON payload to your specified URL via HTTP `POST`.
The payload contains the following fields:

- `action`: One of `create`, `update`, or `delete`, indicating the type of event
- `event`: One of `project`, `cycle`, `module`, or `issue`, indicating the type of event that triggered the webhook
  - _Note: `issue` refers to Work Items in Plane. This will be updated in the future to reflect the correct terminology._
- `webhook_id`: The unique identifier of the webhook
- `workspace_id`: The ID of the workspace where the event occurred
- `data`: An optional object containing the details of the event. The structure
of this field varies based on the `event` and `action` (see below).

### Payload examples

#### Delete action

```json
{
  "event":"issue",
  "action":"delete",
  "webhook_id":"f1a2fe64-c8d4-4eed-b3ef-498690052c1d",
  "workspace_id":"c467e125-59e3-44ec-b5ee-f9c1e138c611",
  "data":{
    "id":"9a28bd00-ed9c-4f5d-8be9-fc05cbb1fc57"
  }
}
```

#### Update action

```json
{
  "event":"project",
  "action":"update",
  "webhook_id":"3c2c32ac-82df-48b3-be2a-a3e21dbe8692",
  "workspace_id":"d2d97c94-a6ad-4012-b526-5577c0d7c769",
  "data": {

      "slug":"testing-project",

    },
    "created_at":"2023-10-25T04:38:59.566962Z",
    "updated_at":"2023-10-25T06:44:48.543685Z",

    "created_by":"6bb20d1c-4960-41ca-af4f-cee01de160c4",
    "updated_by":"6bb20d1c-4960-41ca-af4f-cee01de160c4",
    "workspace":"bob1b192-f988-4bf9-b569-825de8cb0678",
    "default_assignee":null,
    "project_lead":null,
    "estimate":null,
    "default_state":null
  }
}
```

## Webhook headers

When Plane sends a webhook payload, it includes several HTTP headers to help you
identify and verify the request. The most important headers are:

```json
"Content-Type": "application/json",
"X-Plane-Delivery": "f819eff4-cd50-4987-bc97-e5be1e04c94f",
"X-Plane-Event": "project",
"X-Plane-Signature": "7896ae9addb1f73931132b4f3e052bf12c410b837b24898e75dcd660c7"
```

| Header            | Description                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X-Plane-Delivery  | A randomly generated UUID for uniquely identifying the payload |
| X-Plane-Event     | The event for which the webhook was triggered               |
| X-Plane-Signature | A signature generated based on the secret and the payload         |


## Verifying payloads

To verify the authenticity of the webhook payloads, you can use the `X-Plane-Signature` header.
This header contains an HMAC SHA-256 signature of the payload, generated using the secret key
you received when creating the webhook. If the signature in the header matches
the HMAC SHA-256 hash of the incoming payload and your secret, you can be
confident that the payload was sent by Plane and has not been tampered with.

  fastify.post('/webhook', options, async (request, reply) => {
    const receivedSignature = request.headers['x-plane-signature'];
    const payload = JSON.stringify(request.body);

    const computedSignature = createHmac('sha256', secret)
      .update(payload)
      .digest('hex');

    if (receivedSignature !== computedSignature) {
      return reply.status(403).send('Invalid signature');
    }

    // Process the webhook payload
    return reply.status(200).send('Webhook received');
  })
  ```

  expected_signature = hmac.new(secret_token.encode('utf-8'), msg=received_payload, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

  if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, received_signature):
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid Signature provided")
