Plane comes in three editions by how its deployed. Our Cloud is our only hosted edition as of 2025. Additionally, we offer two unique self-hosted editions tailored to meet two sets of unique needs—the open-source Community Edition and the recommended Commercial Edition.

## About our self-hosted editions

### Community Edition

Built with transparency in mind, the Community Edition:

- Is governed by the AGPL v3.0 license, ensuring free and open usage
- Allows contributions to the repo through modifications and customizations
- Has no code dependencies or restrictions on or from the Commercial Edition

It’s ideal for those who want to try Plane first, audit the code for security, and see how each one of services works with the others. Several tens of thousands of uses have used it and a significant number have contributed to it.

The Community Edition is at par with the Free tier of the Cloud edition in its feature availability. To upgrade to paid plans, you must first switch to the Commercial Edition.
​

### Commercial Edition

Designed for teams that want governance, compliance, and privacy controls, the Commercial Edition is ideal for teams that want to try Plane with an intent to unlock advanced work management and security features.

This edition also comes with a Free tier and allows seamless upgrades to all paid
plans. It offers:

- Full feature parity with our Cloud
- A bundle of 12 free user seats per workspace, so there are no surprises when you upgrade
- An intuitive upgrade flow that automatically calculates the number of seats you need based on the number of users with paid roles in your workspace, so you never have to guess

## Why we separate editions

We’ve designed Plane’s editions to serve diverse user needs while staying true to the
ethos of open source.

- The **Community Edition** is completely open-source, with no restrictions beyond those outlined in the [AGPL v3.0 license](https://github.com/makeplane/plane/blob/preview/LICENSE.txt). This is the edition that is now ranking at #1 in our space on GitHub.
- The **Commercial Edition** remains closed-source to offer enterprise-grade features and seamless scalability for businesses.

Unlike some open-core companies, we’ve adopted a clean separation to keep things
simple and transparent. There’s no hidden code that limits modifications on the
Community Edition, and no forced migrations from one edition to another.

## Differences in versions between Editions

Each of our editions is built on a distinct codebase. Versions differ based on how we
ship new code according to our three separate release cycles. This distinction allows
us to:

- Use the Cloud as a test bed for new features before they come to our self-hosted editions
- Innovate quickly on a more controlled Commercial Edition
- Be intentional and deliberate with changes to the Community Edition

For both the Commercial and Community Editions, version updates are in your control.
Regular updates ensure you benefit from the latest features and improvements. See
[Update Plane](/self-hosting/manage/update/to-latest-version) for how to upgrade your
versions.
