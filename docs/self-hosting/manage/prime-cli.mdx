Our command-line tool is here to make managing your Plane instance simple. You can handle installs, upgrades, and general management without needing to be a Docker expert.

## Commercial Edition • Prime CLI

:::note
If you are on the Community edition and want to upgrade to the Commercial edition, see [Upgrade to Commercial Edition](/self-hosting/manage/upgrade/upgrade-from-community).
:::

Prime CLI provides commands for common tasks like configuring services, monitoring health, managing backups, and upgrading your Plane instance.

Bring up Prime CLI with `sudo prime-cli` from any directory on your machine.

### Prime CLI Commands

- `start` starts a service in the Docker network
- `stop` stops a service in the Docker network
- `restart` restarts a service in the Docker network
- `monitor` allows you to see if services are up or down and access their [logs](/self-hosting/manage/view-logs)
- `healthcheck` shows you the service status and errors, if any
- `repair` automatically diagnoses and fixes common errors. This command also resets all configuration values in the plane.env file to their defaults.
- `update-cli` downloads and installs the latest version of Prime CLI

  :::tip
  It is highly recommend to run `update-cli` before you download any Plane updates. The latest version of the CLI ensures your Plane upgrades happen smoothly.

- `configure` brings up a step form to let you specify the following:

<details>
<summary>Configuration steps</summary>
    - `Listening port`

          Specify the port that the built-in reverse proxy will use

          Default value: 80

      - `Max file-upload size`

          Specify a size in MBs for how big each file uploaded to your Plane app can be

          Default value: 5 MB

      - `External Postgres URL`

          Specify the URL of your own hosted Postgres if you would like to change the database your Plane app uses.

          Default database: Postgres 15.5 in the Docker container

      - `External Redis URL`

          Specify the URL of your own hosted REdis if you would like to change the default Redis Plane ships with.

          Default Redis: Redis 7.2.4

      - `External storage`

          Specify your AWS S3 bucket's credentials in the format below to change storage from the default Plane ships with.
              - AWS Access Key ID
              - AWS Secret Access Key
              - AWS S3 Bucket Name

                  Default storage: MinIO

          - Confirm your choices on the screen ↓.

              This restarts your instance with the new configs.

</details>

- `upgrade` checks your instance for available version upgrades. You will be asked for confirmation before downloading the latest available version.
  1. Typing `YES` lets the CLI automatically download the latest version and installs it. Then it restarts the instance to load the latest app.
  2. Typing `NO` cancels the upgrade.

- `uninstall` uninstalls Plane. Before continuing, you are asked for confirmation.
  1. Typing `YES` lets the CLI clean up the `/opt/plane` folder, leaving behind the `/opt/plane/data` and `/opt/plane/logs` folders.
  2. Typing `NO` cancels the uninstall.
