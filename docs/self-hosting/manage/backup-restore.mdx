Backing up your data regularly helps prevent data loss and allows you to restore
your system quickly if necessary. Follow these instructions to back up and
restore your data using Plane’s command-line interface.

## Backup Data

Create a backup of your Plane data:

```bash
sudo prime-cli backup
```

This command initiates a full backup of all critical data, storing it in the
default backup location:

```bash
/opt/plane/backups
```

Each backup file is timestamped so you can easily identify the latest or a
specific backup if needed.

## Backup plane.env

If you need to back up only the `plane.env` file, do it manually:

1. Navigate to the `/opt/plane` folder on your machine or server where Plane is installed.
2. Locate the `plane.env` file.
3. Copy this file to a different location as a backup, so you can restore it if needed.

## Restore Data

You can restore your data from a previous backup:

```bash
sudo prime-cli restore
```

This command prompts the restoration process, which will overwrite the current
data with the data from the most recent backup file. Ensure you have selected
the correct backup before running this command, as restoring will replace your
current data.

    ## Backup and Restore Community Edition Data

    To create a backup, start by running the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    You’ll see a menu of options—type 7 to select "Backup Data."

    ```
    Select an Action you want to perform:
    1) Install (x86_64)
    2) Start
    3) Stop
    4) Restart
    5) Upgrade
    6) View Logs
    7) Backup Data
    8) Exit

    Action [2]: 7
    ```
    The system will start backing up the PostgreSQL, Redis, and upload data:

    ```
    Backing Up plane-app_pgdata
    Backing Up plane-app_redisdata
    Backing Up plane-app_uploads

    Backup completed successfully. Backup files are stored in /....../plane-app/backup/20240502-1120
    ```
    The backup files are stored locally, so you can copy them to an external
    storage service if needed for extra security.

    ## Backup plane.env
    If you need to back up only the `plane.env` file, do it manually:

    1. Navigate to the folder on your machine or server where Plane is installed.
    2. Locate the `plane.env` file.
    3. Copy this file to a different location as a backup, so you can restore it if needed.

    ## Restore Data
    Follow these steps to restore data from a backup:

    1. Make sure Plane-CE is installed and started, then stop it. This ensures the necessary Docker volumes are ready.
    2. Use the command below to download the restore script. It’s easiest to save it in the same directory as `setup.sh`.
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL -o restore.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/master/deploy/selfhost/restore.sh
        chmod +x restore.sh
        ```
    3. Now, run the command below to restore your data, specifying the path to your backup folder (the folder with the `*.tar.gz` files):
        ```bash
        ./restore.sh <path to backup folder containing *.tar.gz files>
        ```

        Here’s an example output for restoring from /opt/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240722-0914:

        ```bash
            --------------------------------------------

            .....Successfully restored volume plane-app_uploads from uploads.tar.gz


            Restore completed successfully.
        ```
    4. Start your Plane instance again:
        ```bash
        ./setup.sh start
        ```

    That’s it! You’re back up and running with your restored data.
