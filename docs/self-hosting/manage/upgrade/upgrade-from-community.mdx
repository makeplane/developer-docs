The Commercial Edition comes with the free plan and the flexibility to upgrade to
a paid plan at any point.

:::warning IMPORTANT

Make sure you already have the Commercial Edition installed on a fresh machine
before starting this migration. If you havenâ€™t installed it yet, follow our
[Commercial Edition](/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose) installation guide
first.

The instructions provided on this page are specific to installations using
Docker. If you are running Plane on Kubernetes, you'll need to manually create a
database dump and back up your file storage by copying the relevant volumes or
storage paths.
:::

## Prerequisites

- Install the [Commercial Edition](/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose) on a fresh machine, not the one running the Plane Community Edition.
- Log in as the root user or as a user with sudo access. The `/opt` directory requires sudo or root privileges.

## Back Up Data on Community Instance

1. Download the latest version of `setup.sh`:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/makeplane/plane/releases/latest/download/setup.sh -o setup.sh
   ```

2. Run the setup.sh backup script to back up the Community Edition instance:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh backup
   ```
3. When done, your data will be backed up to the directory shown on the screen, e.g., `/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240522-1027`. This directory will contain 3 `tar.gz` files:
   - `pgdata.tar.gz`
   - `redisdata.tar.gz`
   - `uploads.tar.gz`

4. Copy all 3 files from the server running the Community Edition to any directory on the server running the Commercial Edition, in any directory of your choice (e.g., `~/ce-backup`).

## Restore Data on Commercial Instance

1. Start any command-line interface like Terminal and go into the directory with the backup files:
   ```bash
   cd ~/ce-backup
   ```
2. Copy and paste the script below into your terminal and hit Enter:

   ```bash
   TARGET_DIR=/opt/plane/data
   sudo mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR
   for FILE in *.tar.gz; do
       if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
           tar -xzvf "$FILE" -C "$TARGET_DIR"
       else
           echo "No .tar.gz files found in the current directory."
           exit 1
       fi
   done

   mv $TARGET_DIR/pgdata/ $TARGET_DIR/db
   mv $TARGET_DIR/redisdata/ $TARGET_DIR/redis
   mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR/minio
   mv $TARGET_DIR/uploads/ $TARGET_DIR/minio/uploads/
   ```

3. This script will extract your Community Edition data and restore it to `/opt/plane/data`.
