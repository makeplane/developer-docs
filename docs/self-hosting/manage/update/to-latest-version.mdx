## Prerequisites

We recommend creating a backup of your data before any version updates. See
[Backup and restore data](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore).

## Check Version

You can quickly check your Plane version by clicking the **?** icon on the
sidebar.

## Update Version

1. Update your Prime CLI with the command below:

    :::warning
    For Commercial Edition v1.13.0, ensure you're using the **latest version of
    Docker Compose**. Check your Docker Compose version with `docker-compose
    --version` and update if needed.
    :::

    ```bash
    sudo prime-cli update-cli
    ```

    The latest version of the CLI ensures your Plane upgrades happen smoothly.

2. To update Plane to the latest version, run:
   ```bash
   sudo prime-cli upgrade
   ```
   This command checks for the latest version of Plane and applies the upgrade if
   a new version is available.

  running version 0.13.2 or below, first follow the guide to [upgrade to version
  v0.14.0](/self-hosting/manage/update/from-0.13.2-0.14.0) before continuing with
  these steps.

  ## Download and Update Community Edition

  1.  Download the latest stable release:

      ```bash
      curl -fsSL -o setup.sh https://github.com/makeplane/plane/releases/latest/download/setup.sh
      ```

  2.  Execute the setup script:

      ```bash
      ./setup.sh
      ```

      This will bring up a menu with several options. Select option `5` to upgrade:

      ```bash
      Select an Action you want to perform:
        1) Install (x86_64)
        2) Start
        3) Stop
        4) Restart
        5) Upgrade
        6) View Logs
        7) Backup Data
        8) Exit

      Action [2]: 5
      ```

      Choosing this option stops all services and downloads the latest
      `docker-compose.yaml` and `variables-upgrade.env` files. The `plane.env`
      file won’t be overwritten, so your existing environment settings are safe.

      You’ll see a message indicating the services have been stopped.

  3.  After the update completes, select `6` to exit the prompt.

  4.  After the upgrade, open `variables-upgrade.env` and compare it with your `plane.env` file. Copy any new variables from `variables-upgrade.env` to your `plane.env` file and set the correct values. This step is essential to ensure that all configuration changes are in place for the latest version.

  5.  Once your `plane.env` file is updated, start your Plane instance again by selecting option `2`.
