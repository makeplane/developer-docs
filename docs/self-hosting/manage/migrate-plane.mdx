Switching to another machine is straightforward on the Commercial Edition.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure:

- You’re running Plane's Commercial Edition.
- You have a different machine with the standard configuration to migrate to.
- You understand that the same domain will be used to host the app as on the current machine.

:::warning
If you need to change your domain during migration, contact our support team for
assistance.

## Steps

1. **Delink licenses**
   Log in to Plane on your current server. Go to each paid workspace (such as One
   or Pro) and [delink the licenses](https://docs.plane.so/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan#delink-license-key).
   This will free up the licenses for activation on your new server. Ideally, you
   have just one paid workspace.

2. **Backup data**
   Create a backup of your Plane instance:
   ```bash
   prime-cli backup
   ```
   This command will generate a backup file at `/opt/plane/backups`.

3. **Set up Plane on the new server**
   Follow the [installation guide](/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose#install-plane)
   to deploy Plane on the new instance.

4. **Transfer backup files**
   Copy the `backups` folder from the old server (created in step 2) to the new
   server. Place the backup in the `/opt/plane` directory.

5. **Restore data**
   On the new server, restore your data:
   ```bash
   prime-cli restore
   ```
   Follow the prompts during the restore process to ensure everything is set up
   correctly.

6. **Reactivate license**
   Finally, [reactivate your license keys](https://docs.plane.so/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan#self-hosted-only)
   on the new instance.

This should get your Plane instance up and running on the new server.
