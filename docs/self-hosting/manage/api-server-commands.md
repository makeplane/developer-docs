# API Server Commands

This page lists all custom Django management commands available in the Plane API server. These commands help you manage users, configure your instance, maintain data integrity, and perform administrative operations.

All commands are run via:

```bash
python manage.py <command> [arguments]
```

Or inside Docker:

```bash
docker compose exec api python manage.py <command> [arguments]
```

## User management

### `update_deleted_workspace_slug`

Appends a deletion timestamp to a soft-deleted workspace's slug, freeing up the original slug name for reuse. Useful when a workspace was deleted but its slug is still blocking creation of a new workspace with the same name.

```bash
python manage.py update_deleted_workspace_slug my-workspace
python manage.py update_deleted_workspace_slug my-workspace --dry-run
```
