This guide explains how to deploy a self-hosted instance of Plane using
Coolify.

## Prerequisites

- A Coolify instance set up and accessible
- Support for amd64 or arm64 architectures

## Download Deployment Files

1. Download the required deployment files for your Plane version:
   - `coolify-compose.yml` — Defines Plane's services and dependencies.
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/releases/<plane-version>/coolify-compose.yml -o coolify-compose.yml
     ```
   - `variables.env` — Stores environment variables for your deployment.
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/releases/<plane-version>/variables.env -o plane.env
     ```
     :::warning
     Replace `<plane-version>` with v1.8.2 or higher.
     :::

## Configure Environment Variables

Edit `plane.env` and set the following variables:

- `DOMAIN_NAME` — (required) Your application's domain name
- `SITE_ADDRESS` — (required) The full domain name (FQDN) of your instance
- `MACHINE_SIGNATURE` — (required) Unique identifier for your machine. Generate with:
  ```sh
  sed -i 's/MACHINE_SIGNATURE=.*/MACHINE_SIGNATURE='$(openssl rand -hex 16)'/' plane.env
  ```
- `CERT_EMAIL` — (optional) Email for SSL certificate generation (needed for HTTPS)

## Configure External Services

:::warning
For production, configure external database and storage to ensure data security
and reliability. Relying on local storage increases the risk of data loss and
service disruption.
:::

- `DATABASE_URL` — Connection string for your external database
- `REDIS_URL` — Connection string for your external Redis instance
- `AMQP_URL` — Connection string for your external RabbitMQ server

## Deploy with Coolify

1. In Coolify, create a new stack.
2. Upload the `coolify-compose.yml` file.
3. Load environment variables from the `plane.env` file.
4. Click **Deploy**.

Once deployment is complete, Plane should be running on your configured domain.
