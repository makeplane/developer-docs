## Install Plane

Plane Pro and Plane Business are enabled on this edition, so the Free plan is
ideal for trialing paid features.

### Prerequisites

- A virtual or on-prem machine with at least 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
- `x64` (AMD 64) or `AArch 64` (ARM 64) CPUs
- Supported operating systems:
  - Ubuntu
  - Debian
  - CentOS
  - Amazon Linux 2 or Linux 2023

:::tip
Use the **latest version of Docker Compose**. Check with
`docker-compose --version` and update if needed.
:::

### Procedure

1. SSH into your machine as root or a user with sudo access.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/install/ | sh -
   ```
3. Follow the terminal instructions. Press `Enter` to continue.
4. Enter the domain name where you will access Plane (e.g., `domain.tld` or `subdomain.domain.tld`). For paid plans, the domain linked to the license cannot be changed later.
5. Choose one of the following:
   - **Express**: Installs Plane with default configurations.
   - **Advanced**: Lets you customize the database, Redis, storage, and other settings.
     :::warning
     For production, configure [external database and storage](/self-hosting/govern/database-and-storage) to ensure data security and reliability. Relying on local storage increases the risk of data loss and service disruption.
     :::
6. Wait for installation to complete. When you see **Plane has successfully installed**, access Plane at the domain you provided.

upgrades](https://docs.plane.so/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan).

  <summary>Install Community Edition</summary>

The Commercial edition includes a free plan and the flexibility to upgrade. If
you want to install the Community edition, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running. Choose one of the following options:
  - **Option 1**
    Create an EC2 machine on AWS. It must of minimum **t3.medium/t3a.medium**.
    Run the below command to install docker engine.
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh -
    ```
  - **Option 2**
    Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- OS with bash scripting enabled (Ubuntu, Linux AMI, macos). Windows systems need to have [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- User context used must have access to docker services. In most cases, use `sudo su` to switch as root user.
- Use the terminal (or gitbash) window to run all the future steps.

### Installation

1. Create a folder named `plane-selfhost` on your machine for deployment and data storage.

   ```bash
   mkdir plane-selfhost
   ```

2. Navigate to this folder using the cd command.
   ```bash
   cd plane-selfhost
   ```
3. Download the latest stable release.
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL -o setup.sh https://github.com/makeplane/plane/releases/latest/download/setup.sh
   ```
4. Make the file executable.
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
5. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This will prompt you with the below options.
   ```list
   Select a Action you want to perform:
     1) Install (arm64)
     2) Start
     3) Stop
     4) Restart
     5) Upgrade
     6) View Logs
     7) Backup Data
     8) Exit
   Action [2]: 1
   ```
6. Enter `1` as input.
   This will create a folder `plane-app` or `plane-app-preview` (in case of
   preview deployment) and will download the `docker-compose.yaml` and
   `plane.env` files.
7. Enter `8` to exit.
8. Set up the environment variables. You can use any text editor to edit this file. Below are the most importants keys you must refer to:
   - `NGINX_PORT`: This is set to `80` by default. Make sure the port you choose to use is not preoccupied. For example, `NGINX_PORT=8080`
   - `WEB_URL`: This is set to `http://localhost` by default. Change this to the FQDN you plan to use along with NGINX_PORT. For example, `https://plane.example.com:8080` or `http://[IP-ADDRESS]:8080`.
   - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: This is set to `http://localhost` by default. Change this to the FQDN you plan to use along with NGINX_PORT. For example, `https://plane.example.com:8080` or `http://[IP-ADDRESS]:8080`.
9. Run the following command to continue with the setup.
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
10. Enter `2` as input to start the services.
    You will something like this:

    ![Downloading docker images](/images/docker-compose/download-docker.png)

    Be patient as it might take some time based on your download speed and
    system configuration. If all goes well, you must see something like this:

    ![Downloading completed](/images/docker-compose/download-complete.png)

    This is the confirmation that all images were downloaded and the services
    are up and running.

You have successfully self-hosted the Plane instance. Access the application
by going to IP or domain you have configured it on. For example,
`https://plane.example.com:8080` or `http://[IP-ADDRESS]:8080`.

#### Stop server

In case you want to make changes to the environment variables in the
`plane.env` file, we recommend that you stop the services before doing that.

Run the `./setup.sh` command. Enter `3` to stop the services.

If all goes well, you will see something like this:

![Stop Services](/images/docker-compose/stopped-docker.png)

#### Restart server

In case you want to make changes to `plane.env` variables without stopping the
server or noticed some abnormalities in services, you can restart the
services.

Run the `./setup.sh` command. Enter `4` to restart the services.

If all goes well, you will see something like this:

![Restart Services](/images/docker-compose/restart-docker.png)
