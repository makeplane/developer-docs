This guide shows you how to deploy a self-hosted instance of Plane Commercial
Edition using Docker Swarm.

## Install Plane

### Prerequisites

- A Docker Swarm environment set up and ready
- Support for amd64 or arm64 architectures

### Procedure

1. **Download the required deployment files**
   - `swarm-compose.yml` — Defines Plane's services and dependencies.
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/releases/<plane-version>/swarm-compose.yml -o swarm-compose.yml
     ```
   - `variables.env` — Stores environment variables for your deployment.
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/releases/<plane-version>/variables.env -o plane.env
     ```
     :::warning
     The `<plane-version>` value should be v1.8.3 or higher.
     :::

2. **Configure environment variables**
   Edit the `variables.env` file and update:
   - `DOMAIN_NAME` — (required) Your application's domain name
   - `SITE_ADDRESS` — (required) The full domain name (FQDN) of your instance
   - `MACHINE_SIGNATURE` — (required) Unique identifier for your machine. Generate with:
     ```sh
     sed -i 's/MACHINE_SIGNATURE=.*/MACHINE_SIGNATURE='$(openssl rand -hex 16)'/' plane.env
     ```
   - `CERT_EMAIL` — (optional) Email for SSL certificate generation (needed for HTTPS)

3. **Configure external DB, Redis, and RabbitMQ**
   :::warning
   For production, configure external database and storage to ensure data
   security and reliability. Relying on local storage increases the risk of data
   loss and service disruption.
   :::
   - `DATABASE_URL` — Connection string for your external database
   - `REDIS_URL` — Connection string for your external Redis instance
   - `AMQP_URL` — Connection string for your external RabbitMQ server

4. **Load the environment variables**

   ```bash
   set -o allexport; source <path-to variables.env>; set +o allexport;
   ```

5. **Deploy the stack**
   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c <path-to swarm-compose.yml> plane
   ```

That's it! This will deploy Plane as a Swarm stack, and your instance should be
accessible on your configured domain.
