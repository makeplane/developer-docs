This guide shows you the steps to deploy a self-hosted instance of Plane using Podman Quadlets.

## Prerequisites

- A non-root user account with `systemd --user support` (most modern Linux setups have this)
- Podman version **4.4 or higher**

## Set up Podman
1. Add the Podman repository.
    ```bash
    echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/alvistack/Debian_12/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/home:alvistack.list
    ```

2. Add the GPG key.
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:alvistack/Debian_12/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/home_alvistack.gpg > /dev/null
    ```

3. Refresh your package lists.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

4. Install Podman and its dependencies.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y podman uidmap netavark passt
    ```

    The `uidmap` package handles user namespace mapping, `netavark` takes care of networking, and `passt` helps with network connectivity. 

## Install Plane

1. Download and extract Podman Quadlets.    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/releases/<plane-version>/podman-quadlets.tar.gz -o podman-quadlets.tar.g
    tar -xzf podman-quadlets.tar.gz
    cd podman-quadlets
    ```
    :::warning
     Replace `<plane-version>` with the [latest version](https://plane.so/changelog?category=self-hosted). (e.g., v1.13.0).
   :::

   The directory contains an `install.sh` script that will handle the installation and configuration.

2. The installation script sets up Plane and configures all required services. You have two options:

   **Without sudo access**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh --domain your-domain.com --base-dir /your/custom/path
    ```
    This installs Plane in your specified directory, which is useful if you want to maintain control over the installation location.

   **With sudo access**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh --domain your-domain.com
    ```
    This installs Plane in `/opt/plane`, which is a standard system location.

   :::note
   Systemd configurations are installed in `~/.config/containers/systemd/`
   :::

## Start Plane

:::warning
**Important**  
Note that you should run these commands without `sudo`.
:::

1. Reload systemd to recognize new configurations.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    ```

2. Start the network service.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user start plane-nw-network.service
    ```

3. Start core dependencies.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user start plane-{db,redis,mq,minio}.service
    ```

4. Start backend services.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user start {api,worker,beat-worker,migrator,monitor}.service
    ```

5. Start frontend services.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user start {web,space,admin,live,proxy}.service
    ```

The startup sequence is important: network first, then dependencies, followed by backend services, and finally frontend services.

### Verify service status
Check that all services are running correctly:

1. Check network status.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user status plane-nw-network.service
    ```

2. Check core dependencies.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user status plane-{db,redis,mq,minio}.service
    ```

3. Check backend services.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user status {api,worker,beat-worker,migrator,monitor}.service
    ```

4. Check frontend services.
    ```bash
    systemctl --user status {web,space,admin,live,proxy}.service
    ```

Your Plane installation should now be running successfully with Podman Quadlets. This setup provides automatic service restart capabilities and standard systemd management commands for maintaining your installation.

## Troubleshoot

To debug service issues, examine the logs using:
    ```bash
    journalctl --user -u <service-name> --no-pager
    ```

The logs will provide detailed information about any configuration issues or errors that may occur.
