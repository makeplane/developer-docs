## Failed to update Prime CLI

<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>
  Error: Failed to update Prime CLI, please contact support or try again later.
</div>

This error typically occurs if you're using an older version of the Prime CLI. To fix it:

1. Take a [data backup](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore#backup-data) to be safe.
2. Remove the existing CLI:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /usr/bin/prime-cli
   ```
3. Install the latest version of the CLI:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/install/ | sh
   ```
