This guide is designed to help you resolve common issues encountered while installing Plane. Each section includes potential causes and step-by-step solutions for identified problems.

## Error during Docker Compose execution

<div style={{color:"red"}}> 
    Error: Error during docker compose execution. Please check permissions and try again.
</div>

- This error typically occurs when the user doesn't have sudo or root privileges. To resolve this, ensure you're logged in as the root user or as a user with sudo access before attempting the installation again.

- The issue may also be caused by using the older version of Docker Compose `docker-compose`. To fix this, install the latest version of Docker Compose `docker compose` and make sure the old version is removed.

## Migrator container exited

<div style={{color:"red"}}> 
    Error: plane-migrator-1 container exited with status 1
</div>

This error typically occurs if you have configured an external database that is running on localhost. Since the connection is being attempted from inside the container, localhost wonâ€™t work, as the database is not running within the container.

To resolve this issue, ensure that the database is hosted on a network-accessible server rather than localhost. Update the database URL to reflect the correct server address. See [how to configure external db](/self-hosting/govern/database-and-storage).
