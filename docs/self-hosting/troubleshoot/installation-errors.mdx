This guide helps you resolve common issues encountered while installing Plane.
Each section includes potential causes and step-by-step solutions.

## Error during Docker Compose execution

<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>
  Error: Error during docker compose execution. Please check permissions and try again.
</div>

- This error typically occurs when the user lacks sudo or root privileges. To
  resolve, ensure you're logged in as root or as a user with sudo access before
  attempting installation again.
- The issue may also be caused by using an older version of Docker Compose
  (`docker-compose`). To fix, install the latest version of Docker Compose
  (`docker compose`) and remove the old version.

## Migrator container exited

<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>
  Error: plane-migrator-1 container exited with status 1
</div>

This error typically occurs if you have configured an external database running
on localhost. Since the connection is attempted from inside the container,
localhost wonâ€™t work unless the database is also running within the container.

To resolve, ensure the database is hosted on a network-accessible server rather
than localhost. Update the database URL to reflect the correct server address.
See [how to configure external db](/self-hosting/govern/database-and-storage).
