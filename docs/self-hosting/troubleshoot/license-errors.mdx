This guide helps you resolve common issues encountered while activating the
license key for a workspace. Each section includes potential causes and
step-by-step solutions.

## License is invalid

<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>Error: Your license is invalid or already in use.</div>

- This issue usually occurs when your server cannot connect to verify the
  license. Try running `prime-cli restart` to resolve the problem.
- If you migrated Plane to a new server without first [delinking the license
  key](https://docs.plane.so/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan#delink-license-key)
  from the old server, this error might occur. In that case, contact support to
  have the license key delinked. For future moves, follow [this
  guide](/self-hosting/manage/migrate-plane) to ensure a smooth transition.

## Something went wrong

<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>
  Error: Something went wrong, please try again later
</div>

This error usually occurs when the license validation service is unavailable.
Troubleshooting steps:

1. Confirm your Plane instance is running the latest version.
2. If not, [update to the latest version](/self-hosting/manage/update/to-latest-version#prerequisites).

Updating typically resolves this issue. If the problem persists, check your
network connection and any firewall rules that might block access to the license
validation service.

## Payment server is not configured

<div style={{ color: 'red' }}>Error: Payment server is not configured</div>

This usually occurs when the environment configuration is incorrect. The
`payment_server_url` environment variable is missing. To fix:

1. Back up the `plane.env` file. See [this guide](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore#backup-planeenv).
2. Run `prime-cli repair` to let Prime CLI attempt automatic fixes to the `plane.env` file.
3. Try activating your workspace with the license key.
4. If needed, configure the instance in [God mode](/self-hosting/govern/instance-admin#settings) or adjust the environment variables directly in the new `plane.env` file.
