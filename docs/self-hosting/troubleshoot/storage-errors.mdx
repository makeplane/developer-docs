This guide helps you resolve common issues encountered while configuring storage
in Plane. Each section includes potential causes and step-by-step solutions.

## Bucket policy exceeds size limit

<div style={{ color: "red" }}>
  Error: An error occurred (PolicyTooLarge) when calling the PutBucketPolicy operation: Policy exceeds the maximum
  allowed document size.
</div>

This error occurs when the bucket policy exceeds the 20KB size limit allowed by
MinIO. It typically happens when trying to add complex policies or when
unnecessary data bloats the policy size.

To resolve this issue, define a streamlined bucket policy file and apply it
within the MinIO container:

1. **Create a bucket policy JSON file**
   - On your local machine, create a file named `bucket-policy.json` with the
     following content:

     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": { "AWS": ["*"] },
           "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
           "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::uploads/*"],
           "Condition": {
             "StringEquals": {
               "s3:ExistingObjectTag/publicAccess": ["true"]
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

- Save this file in an accessible location.

2. **Set up and apply the policy**
   :::warning
   **IMPORTANT**
   Execute all `mc` commands **within the MinIO container** (attach or use `docker exec`).
   :::

- Configure MinIO alias:

  ```bash
  mc alias set myminio http://plane-plane-minio:9000 <minio-username> <minio-password>
  ```

  Replace `plane-plane-minio:9000` with your MinIO server address.

- Tag existing objects:

  ```bash
  mc find myminio/uploads --exec "mc tag set {} publicAccess=true"
  ```

- Copy the policy file to the MinIO container:

  ```bash
  docker cp bucket-policy.json <minio-container-id>:/tmp
  ```

  Replace `<minio-container-id>` with your MinIO container ID (find it with `docker ps`).

- Apply the policy to the bucket:
  ```bash
  mc anonymous set-json /tmp/bucket-policy.json myminio/uploads
  ```

3. **Verification**

- Verify that objects are correctly tagged:
  ```bash
  mc tag list myminio/uploads/<object-name>
  ```
- Test public access:
  ```bash
  curl http://<minio-server>:9000/uploads/<object-name>
  ```

### Notes

- Ensure the `access-key` and `secret-key` used for the alias have adequate
  permissions to manage the bucket.
- If your MinIO server is on a different machine or address, update the server
  URL accordingly.
- After applying the policy, test the setup to confirm it works as expected.
