# Deploy Plane on your infrastructure

Take complete control of your project management infrastructure by deploying Plane on your own servers. Self-hosting Plane gives you full ownership of your data and the flexibility to deploy wherever you need - from a single Docker container to enterprise Kubernetes clusters.

## Why self-host Plane?

**Data sovereignty and privacy**  
Keep all your project data within your own infrastructure. Perfect for organizations with strict data residency requirements or privacy regulations.

**Complete control**  
Customize every aspect of Plane to match your workflows. Control when and how updates are applied, and integrate with your existing tools and infrastructure.

**Compliance and security**  
Meet regulatory requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, or industry-specific standards by maintaining full control over data storage and access.

**No vendor lock-in**  
Your data remains accessible in open formats. Migrate, backup, or customize without restrictions.
