## Authentication methods

### Unique code

Plane lets your users log in with codes sent over email. This is disabled if SMTP is
not configured for your instance. See [Communication](https://app.plane.so/plane/projects/e3ea12b0-62e3-4b8d-8ada-3379f4efc563/pages/e83af23e-b120-47b0-b241-2bee39037505)
to set up SMTP if you wish to enable unique codes.

### Passwords

Your users can log in with passwords that they or you set for them. This is toggled on when SMTP isn't configured for your instance. Disable it if you would like to use another authentication method below.
