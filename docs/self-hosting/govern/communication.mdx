- **Host**\
  The address of your SMTP server.
- **Port**\
  The port for outgoing emails.
- **Sender email address**\
  The email address you wish to use as the sender of emails.
- **Email security**\
  Toggle `TLS` or `SSL` as the email security layer for your emails. If you do not wish to use either of them, you can choose the `No email security` option.
- **Authentication**\
  You can configure the username and password to authenticate the SMTP server to send emails. It's an optional configuration, but we would advise you to provide authentication details for a secure email delivery experience.
  - **Username**\
    Specify the username for the SMTP configuration here.
  - **Password**\
    Specify the password for the SMTP configuration here.

:::tip
**Google Workspaces**

If your Plane instance is not accessible on the internet, Gmail may block profile photos or other embedded images in email notifications. This occurs because Gmail uses Google's secure image proxy to serve images for security purposes.

To resolve this issue, you must configure the Image URL proxy allowlist in your Google Workspace settings to include your Plane instance's URL. Refer to Google’s documentation for instructions: [Allowlist image URLs](https://support.google.com/a/answer/3299041?hl=en).
