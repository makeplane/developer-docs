:::info
Plane currently supports SMTP authentication only via email and password.
OAuth-based SMTP configurations aren’t supported.

## Configuration

Plane provides an interface to configure Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and SSL
for encrypted email communication.

Navigate to `Email` in `/god-mode` and you will see the following screen:

![](/images/instance-admin/email-settings.png#center)

- **Host**: The address of your SMTP server.
- **Port**: The port for outgoing emails.
- **Sender email address**: The email address you wish to use as the sender.
- **Email security**: Toggle `TLS` or `SSL` as the security layer for your emails. If you do not wish to use either, you can choose the `No email security` option.
- **Authentication**: Configure the username and password to authenticate the SMTP server. This is optional, but recommended for secure email delivery.
  - **Username**: Specify the username for SMTP authentication.
  - **Password**: Specify the password for SMTP authentication.

:::tip
**Google Workspaces**

If your Plane instance is not accessible on the internet, Gmail may block profile
photos or other embedded images in email notifications. This occurs because Gmail
uses Google's secure image proxy to serve images for security purposes.

To resolve this, configure the Image URL proxy allowlist in your Google Workspace
settings to include your Plane instance's URL. Refer to Google’s documentation:
[Allowlist image URLs](https://support.google.com/a/answer/3299041?hl=en).
