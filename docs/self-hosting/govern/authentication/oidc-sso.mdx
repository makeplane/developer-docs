Plane One enables custom SSO via any identity provider with an official and supported
implementation of OIDC standards. This page uses Okta as an example, but
provider-specific instructions will be published in phases.

## OIDC

You will need to configure values on your IdP first, then on Plane.

### On your preferred IdP

Create a Plane client or application per your IdP's documentation and configure as
follows:

:::tip
`domain.tld` is the domain where your Plane app is hosted.
:::

| **Config**   | **Key**                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Origin URL   | `http(s)://domain.tld/auth/oidc/`          |
| Callback URL | `http(s)://domain.tld/auth/oidc/callback/` |
| Logout URL   | `http(s)://domain.tld/auth/oidc/logout/`   |

### On Plane

Go to `/god-mode/authentication/oidc` on your Plane app and find the configs below.

:::tip
Your IdP will generate some of the following configs for you. Others, you will specify
yourself. Just copy them over to each field.

- Copy the `CLIENT_ID` for the Plane client or app you just created from your IdP and paste it in the field for it.
  - With providers like Keycloak, you must choose a unique ID per app you configure. With providers like Okta and Auth0, copy over the generated ID from your IdP. Typically, you will find it on the Plane application Home or Settings page on your IdP.
- Copy the `CLIENT_SECRET` for the Plane client or app you created from your IdP and paste it in the field for it. The secret is usually auto-generated.
- Copy the `TOKEN URL` from your IdP and paste it into the field for it on `/god-mode/authentication/oidc/`. This URL is typically in the `.well-known/` directory for the Plane app or client on your IdP.
- Copy the `User info URL` from your IdP and paste it into the field for it on `/god-mode/authentication/oidc/`. This is used to get the authenticating user's `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name` values from the IdP, and is also found in the `.well-known/` directory.
- Copy the `Authorize URL` from the `.well-known/` directory and paste it into the field for it on Plane's `/god-mode/authentication/oidc/`. This is the URL that Plane's login screen redirects to when users click `Sign up with <name of IdP>` or `Login with <name of IdP>`.

  To test if this URL is correct, see if clicking the `Login with <name of your IdP>` button brings up your IdP's authentication screen.
- Finally, choose a name for your IdP on Plane so you can recognize this set of configs.
