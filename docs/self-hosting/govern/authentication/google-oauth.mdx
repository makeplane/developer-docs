Plane ships with out-of-the-box support for Google OAuth, making it the easiest
option for Google Workspace users.

## Configure Plane as an app on Google API Console

First, register Plane as an approved OAuth app with Google:

1. Go to the [Google API console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) and create a new project.
2. Navigate to the **OAuth consent screen** under **APIs & Services**. Choose your configuration and target users, then click **Create**.

4. Go to the **Credentials** screen, click **Create Credentials**, and select **OAuth client ID**.

5. Select **Web application** under **Application type**. Update the following fields:
   1. **Authorized JavaScript origins**: The HTTP origins that host your web application, e.g., `https://app.plane.so`
   2. **Authorized redirect URIs**: Append the path users should be redirected to after authenticating with Google. Use `https://<plane.example.com>/auth/google/callback` and `https://<plane.example.com>/auth/mobile/google/callback/` where `<plane.example.com>` is your self-hosted instance's domain.
   3. Click **Create**.
   4. Get the Client ID and Client secret under **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** on the **Credentials** screen.

## Configure Plane

1. Go to `Google` on the Authentication screen of `/god-mode`.
2. Add the client ID and client secret from the Google API Console.
3. Click `Save`.

Your Plane instance should now support `Sign in with Google`.

:::note
Domain restriction for Google OAuth is not yet supported, but is on our roadmap.
