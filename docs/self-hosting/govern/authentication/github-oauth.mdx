4. Click **Register a new application**.
5. Configure the following OAuth credentials for your Plane app:
   1. **Homepage URL**: The domain (with HTTPS) where you host Plane, e.g., `https://app.plane.so`
   2. **Authorization Callback URL**: Append the path users should be redirected to after authenticating with GitHub. Use `https://<plane.example.com>/auth/github/callback/` and `https://<plane.example.com>/auth/mobile/github/callback/` where `<plane.example.com>` is your self-hosted instance's domain.
6. Click `Register application` to save it.

7. Find the app you just registered and copy the client ID and client secret for the next steps.

## Configure Plane

1. Go to `GitHub` on the Authentication screen of `/god-mode`.
2. Add the client ID and client secret from the GitHub app you just registered.
3. Click `Save`.

Your Plane instance should now support GitHub sign-in.
