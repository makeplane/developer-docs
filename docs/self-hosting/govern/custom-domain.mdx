:::note
With the Commercial Edition, you can set up a custom domain during
installation. If you need to change the domain later, contact our
support team for assistance.

## Community Edition

Our steps differ slightly depending on whether you are hosting on a public IP or a private/internal IP. Follow the steps listed below.

### Update the .env file

:::warning
This step is mandatory for you to host Plane on a custom domain.
:::

Open your project's `.env` file. This file contains configuration settings for
your application. Locate the following lines:

```
WEB_URL=<your domain name with http/https>
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<your domain name with http/https>
```

Replace `<your domain name with http/https>` with your actual domain name,
including the `http://` or `https://` protocol. For example:

```
WEB_URL=https://example.com
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://example.com
```

If you are hosting Plane on a public IP, then follow the steps here. However, if you are hosting Plane on an internal IP then follow these steps.

### Set DNS A record (for public IP)

If your server has a public IP address, you need to configure the DNS A record to point to this IP address. This allows users to access your application using your custom domain name. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

- Log in to your domain registrar's website or DNS hosting provider.
- Navigate to the DNS management section.
- Find the option to edit your domain's DNS records.
- Add a new A record with the hostname set to `@` (or your subdomain if applicable) and the IP address set to your server's public IP address.
- Save the changes. It may take some time for the DNS changes to propagate.

### Configure reverse proxy (for internal IP)

If your server is behind a firewall or router and has an internal IP address, you'll need to set up a reverse proxy to route requests from your custom domain to your server. Follow these steps:

- Configure a CNAME record in your domain's DNS settings that points to your reverse proxy server's hostname. This allows your domain to resolve to the reverse proxy server.

- Set up reverse proxy redirection on your reverse proxy server to forward incoming requests to your server's internal IP address and port.

- Depending on the reverse proxy software you're using (e.g., Nginx, Apache, etc.), the configuration process may vary. Refer to the documentation for your specific reverse proxy server for detailed instructions on setting up reverse proxy redirection.

- Once the reverse proxy is properly configured, ensure that your firewall/router allows incoming traffic on the necessary ports to reach your server.

By following these steps, you will be able to access your self-hosted instance of Plane using your custom domain name, whether your server has a public IP address or is behind a firewall with an internal IP address.
