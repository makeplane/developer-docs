:::note
With the Commercial Edition, you can set up a custom domain during installation. If
you need to change the domain later, contact our support team for assistance.

## Community Edition

The steps for setting up a custom domain differ depending on whether your server has a
public IP or a private/internal IP. Follow the appropriate instructions below.

### Update the .env file

:::warning
This step is mandatory to host Plane on a custom domain.
:::

Open your project's `.env` file and locate the following lines:

```
WEB_URL=<your domain name with http/https>
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<your domain name with http/https>
```

Replace `<your domain name with http/https>` with your actual domain name, including
the `http://` or `https://` protocol. For example:

```
WEB_URL=https://example.com
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://example.com
```

If you are hosting Plane on a public IP, follow the steps in the next section. If you
are hosting Plane on an internal IP, skip to the reverse proxy section.

### Set DNS A record (for public IP)

If your server has a public IP address, configure a DNS A record to point your domain
to this IP. This allows users to access your application using your custom domain.

Steps:

- Log in to your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider.
- Go to the DNS management section.
- Add a new A record with the hostname set to `@` (or your subdomain if applicable) and the IP address set to your server's public IP.
- Save the changes. DNS propagation may take some time.

### Configure reverse proxy (for internal IP)

If your server is behind a firewall or router and has an internal IP address, set up a
reverse proxy to route requests from your custom domain to your server. Steps:

- Configure a CNAME record in your domain's DNS settings that points to your reverse proxy server's hostname. This allows your domain to resolve to the reverse proxy server.
- Set up reverse proxy redirection on your reverse proxy server to forward incoming requests to your server's internal IP address and port.
- Depending on the reverse proxy software you're using (e.g., Nginx, Apache, etc.), the configuration process may vary. Refer to the documentation for your specific reverse proxy server for detailed instructions on setting up reverse proxy redirection.
- Once the reverse proxy is properly configured, ensure that your firewall/router allows incoming traffic on the necessary ports to reach your server.

By following these steps, you can access your self-hosted Plane instance using your
custom domain, whether your server has a public IP or is behind a firewall with an
internal IP.
