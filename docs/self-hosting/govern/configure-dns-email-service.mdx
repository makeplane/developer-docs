This guide explains how to configure DNS settings to enable the [Intake Email](https://docs.plane.so/intake/intake-email) feature for your self-hosted Plane instance. These configurations enable your server to accept messages sent to your project's dedicated Intake address, which are then converted into work items in your project's Intake section.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the Plane server allows inbound traffic on the following email-related ports: `25`, `465`, and `587`.

If any of these ports are currently in use, you can free them by running:

```bash
fuser -k 25/tcp 465/tcp 587/tcp
```

## Generate SSL/TLS Certificate for Email Domain

:::warning
Mandatory for Docker Compose deployments only.
:::

Before configuring DNS records for Intake Email, secure your email domain with
an SSL/TLS certificate. This ensures encrypted communication between mail
servers and improves email trust and deliverability.

1.  **Install Certbot** - Update your system and install Certbot.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install certbot
    ```

    For NGINX:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

    For Apache:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-certbot-apache
    ```

2.  **Generate SSL Certificate** - Choose the method that matches your web server setup:

        For NGINX:
        ```bash
        sudo certbot --nginx -d <mail-domain>
        ```

        For Apache:
        ```bash
        sudo certbot --apache -d <mail-domain>
        ```

        For standalone (no web server):
        ```bash
        sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d <mail-domain>
        ```

3.  **Copy Certificate Files** - Copy the generated certificate files to Plane's expected directory:

        ```bash
        sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<mail-domain>/fullchain.pem /opt/plane/data/email/tls/cert.pem
        sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<mail-domain>/privkey.pem /opt/plane/data/email/tls/key.pem
        ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables** - Add the following settings to your plane.env file:

        ```bash
        # If using SMTP_DOMAIN as FQDN (e.g., intake.example.com),
        # generate a valid SSL certificate and set these paths accordingly.
        SMTP_DOMAIN=intake.example.com
        TLS_CERT_PATH=tls/cert.pem
        TLS_PRIV_KEY_PATH=tls/key.pem
        INTAKE_EMAIL_DOMAIN=intake.example.com
        ```

        :::warning
        Important: `SMTP_DOMAIN` and `INTAKE_EMAIL_DOMAIN` must be identical.
        :::

## Configure DNS records

1.  **Create an A Record**
    This record points to the server running your email service.

        ```bash
        Type: A
        Host: <host-domain>           # Example: plane.example.com
        Value: <public-ip-address>    # Your server's public IP address
        TTL: Auto | 3600
        ```

        :::tip
        You can alternatively use a CNAME record if you're using a cloud load balancer.
        :::

2.  **Add an MX Record**
    This record directs email traffic to your mail server.

    ```bash
    Type: MX
    Host: <mail-domain>           # Example: intake.example.com
    Value: <host-domain>          # Same as your A record host
    Priority: 10
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ```

3.  **Configure an SPF Record**
    This record helps prevent email spoofing.

    ```bash
    Type: TXT
    Host: <mail-domain>           # Example: intake.example.com
    Value: "v=spf1 ip4:<A-record-ip-host-domain> -all"
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ```

4.  **Set Up a DMARC record**
    This record specifies how receiving mail servers should handle authentication failures.

    ```bash
    Type: TXT
    Host: _dmarc.<mail-domain>    # Example: _dmarc.intake.example.com
    Value: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:<valid-email-addr>"
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ```

## Verify your configuration

After setting up your DNS records, verify that they're correctly configured:

    ```bash
    # Verify A record
    dig A <mail-domain>

    # Verify MX record
    dig MX <mail-domain>

    # Verify SPF record
    dig TXT <mail-domain>

    # Verify DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.<mail-domain>
    ```

    You can also use [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com) to check for any issues with your DNS configuration.

## Test your mail server

Once your DNS records have propagated, test your SMTP connections:

    ```bash
    # Test SMTP connection on standard ports
    telnet <host-domain> 25
    telnet <host-domain> 465
    telnet <host-domain> 587
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- MX Record issues
  - Ensure there's a proper dot at the end of the domain.
  - Check that the priority number is correct (lower = higher priority).
  - Allow 24-48 hours for DNS changes to fully propagate.

- A Record issues
  - Verify that the IP address is correct.
  - Ensure your mail subdomain matches the MX record.
