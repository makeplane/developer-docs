This guide walks you through setting up a GitHub App to enable GitHub integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted environments don’t come pre-configured for GitHub, you’ll need to set up the necessary authentication, permissions, and webhooks to ensure smooth integration.

This guide covers configuration for both:

- **[GitHub Cloud](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github?edition=github-cloud#create-github-app)** -
The standard cloud-hosted GitHub service
- **[GitHub Enterprise Server](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github?edition=github-enterprise#create-github-app)** -
Self-hosted GitHub instances for organizations with specific compliance or security requirements

In this guide, you’ll:

1. [Create and configure a GitHub App](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#create-github-app)
2. [Set up permissions and events](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#set-up-permissions-and-events)
3. [Configure your Plane instance](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#configure-plane-instance)

:::warning IMPORTANT
**Activate GitHub integration**

After creating and configuring the GitHub app and configuring the instance as detailed on this page, you'll need to [setup the GitHub integration](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/github) within Plane.
:::

## Create GitHub App

To configure GitHub integration, you'll need to create a GitHub App within your organization.

<Tabs queryString="edition" groupId="editions">
  <TabItem value="github-cloud" label="GitHub Cloud">

  1. Go to **Settings > Developer Settings > GitHub Apps** in your GitHub organization.
  2. Click **New GitHub App**.

      ![Create GitHub App](/images/integrations/github/create-github-app.webp#center)

  3. In the **Register new GitHub App** page, provide a **GitHub App name** and **Homepage URL**.

      ![App name and homepage URL](/images/integrations/github/app-name-homepage-url.webp#center)

  4. In the **Identifying and authorizing users** section, add the following **Callback URLS**.

      ```bash
      https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/callback
      https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/user/callback
      ```

      These URLs allow Plane to verify and enable workspace connection with the Github App.

      ![Add Callback URL](/images/integrations/github/add-callback-url.webp#center)

  5. In the **Post installation** section, add this **Setup URL** and check the box for **Redirect on update**.

      ```bash
      https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/callback
      ```

      ![Add setup URL](/images/integrations/github/add-setup-url.webp#center)

  6. In the **Webhook** section, add the following **Webhook URL** to allow Plane to receive updates from GitHub repositories.

      ```bash
      https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/github-webhook
      ```

      ![Add Webhook URL](/images/integrations/github/add-webhook-url.webp#center)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="github-enterprise" label="GitHub Enterprise Server">
    1. Go to **Settings \> Developer Settings \> GitHub Apps** in your GitHub organization.
    2. Click **New GitHub App**.

        ![Create GitHub App](/images/integrations/github/create-github-app.webp#center)

    3. In the **Register new GitHub App** page, provide a **GitHub App name** and **Homepage URL**.

         ![App name and homepage URL](/images/integrations/github/app-name-homepage-url.webp#center)

    4. In the **Identifying and authorizing users** section, add the following
    **Callback URLs** to allow Plane to verify and enable workspace connections
    with the Github App.

            ```bash
            https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/callback
            https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/user/callback
            ```

         ![Add Callback URL](/images/integrations/github/add-callback-url.webp#center)

    5. In the **Post installation** section,

        - Add the appropriate **Setup URL**, based on your hosting type:

          - **Plane cloud**: `https://silo.plane.so/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/callback`
          - **Self-hosted**: `https://<your-plane-domain>/silo/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/callback`

        - Check the box for **Redirect on update**

        ![Add setup URL](/images/integrations/github/add-setup-url.webp#center)

    6. In the **Webhook** section, add the following **Webhook URL** to allow Plane to receive updates from your GitHub repositories.

        **For Plane cloud**

        ```bash
        https://silo.plane.so/api/github-enterprise/github-webhook
        ```

        **For Plane self-hosted instance**

3. Click the **Create GitHub App** button at the bottom of the page.

## Configure Plane instance

<Tabs queryString="edition" groupId="editions">
  <TabItem value="github-cloud" label="GitHub Cloud">
      1. Go back to **Settings \> Developer Settings \> GitHub Apps**.
      2. Click **Edit** on the GitHub you created.
      3. In the **General** tab, under the **Client secrets** section, click **Generate a new client secret**.
          ![General tab](/images/integrations/github/general-tab.webp#center)
      4. Scroll down to the **Private keys** section.
          ![Private keys](/images/integrations/github/private-keys.webp#center)
      5. Click **Generate a private key**.
      6. Retrieve the following details from the **General** tab:
          - App ID
          - Client ID
          - Client secret
          - GitHub App name
          - Private key
      7. Now add these values as environment variables to your Plane instance's `.env` file.

          :::tip
            Private keys are typically multi-line which can cause parsing errors
            when used as an environment variable. To avoid this, run the
            following command to convert the private key to base64:
            ```bash
            cat private_key.pem | base64 -w 0
            ```
          :::

        ```bash
        # .env
        GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
        GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
        GITHUB_APP_NAME=<app_name>
        GITHUB_APP_ID=<app_id>
        GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>
        ```
      8. Save the file and restart the instance.
