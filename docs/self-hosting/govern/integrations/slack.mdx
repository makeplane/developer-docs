This guide walks you through setting up a Slack App to enable Slack integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted environments don’t come pre-configured for Slack, you’ll need to set up the necessary authentication, permissions, and event subscriptions to ensure seamless communication between Plane and Slack.

In this guide, you’ll:

1. [Create and configure a Slack App](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/slack#create-slack-app)
2. [Configure your Plane instance](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/slack#configure-plane-instance)

:::warning
**Activate Slack integration**

After creating and configuring the Slack app and configuring the instance as detailed on this page, you'll need to [set up the Slack integration](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/slack) within Plane.

## Create Slack App

To configure Slack integration, you'll need to create a Slack App within your organization. Follow these steps:

1.  Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) on Slack.

2.  Click **Create an App**.
    ![Create Slack App](/images/integrations/slack/create-slack-app.webp)

3.  Choose **From a manifest**.
    ![Choose Manifest](/images/integrations/slack/choose-from-manifest.webp)

4.  Select the workspace where you want the app installed.

5.  Remove the default manifest and paste the one below, making sure to update the placeholders with your actual values.

### Manifest reference

The manifest file defines the configuration for integrating Plane with Slack. It requests access to several features, enabling Plane to interact with Slack efficiently.

#### Features

| Feature          | Explanation                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bot_user`       | Required to send thread messages while syncing issues or sending Plane notifications to Slack.                                             |
| `slack_commands` | A Slack command (`/plane`) allows users to create issues directly from Slack using a slash command.                                        |
| `shortcuts`      | After activation, users can create issues from messages inside Slack.                                                                      |
| `unfurl_domain`  | Specifies the domain where Plane is hosted. When an issue, cycle, or module link is pasted in Slack, it generates a preview of the entity. |

#### Variables

| Variable               | Explanation                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `YOUR_DOMAIN`          | The domain where Plane is hosted. This is required for sending webhook events and authentication callbacks. |
| `YOUR_APP_NAME`        | The name you want to give your Slack app. "Plane" is a good default option.                                 |
| `YOUR_APP_DESCRIPTION` | A short description of your Slack app’s purpose.                                                            |

#### Event subscription

For thread sync and link unfurling to work, event subscriptions must be enabled. These events send relevant activity to Plane.

| Bot event          | Explanation                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `link_shared`      | When a link is shared in Slack and its hostname matches `unfurl_domain`, Plane receives the event and generates a preview of the entity. |
| `message_channels` | When a message is posted in a channel, an event is triggered in Plane to support thread sync.                                            |
| `message_im`       | When a direct message (DM) is posted, an event is triggered in Plane to support thread sync.                                             |

#### User permissions

2. Click **Retry** to verify your event subscription URL.
   ![Event subscriptions](/images/integrations/slack/event-subscriptions.webp)

3. Navigate to the **Basic Information** tab on Slack to find your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

4. Add these environment variables with the values to your Plane instance's `.env` file.
   ```bash
   SLACK_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
   SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
   ```
5. Save the file and restart the instance.

6. Once you've completed the instance configuration, [activate the Slack integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/slack).
