# Configure GitHub for Plane integration <Badge type="info" text="Pro" />

This guide walks you through setting up a GitHub App to enable GitHub integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted environments don’t come pre-configured for GitHub, you’ll need to set up the necessary authentication, permissions, and webhooks to ensure smooth integration.

This guide covers configuration for both:

- **[GitHub Cloud](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#github-cloud)**
The standard cloud-hosted GitHub service

- **[GitHub Enterprise Server](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#github-enterprise-server)**
Self-hosted GitHub instances for organizations with specific compliance or security requirements

In this guide, you’ll:
1. [Create and configure a GitHub App](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#create-github-app)
2. [Set up permissions and events](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#set-up-permissions-and-events)
3. [Configure your Plane instance](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#configure-plane-instance)

::: warning
**Activate GitHub integration**

After creating and configuring the GitHub app and configuring the instance as detailed on this page, you'll need to [setup the GitHub integration](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/github) within Plane.

5. Click **Genereate a private key**.

6. Retrieve the following details from the **General** tab:
   - App ID
   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - GitHub App name
   - Private key

7. Before adding the Private key as an environment variable, you'll need to convert it to base64. Since private keys are typically multi-line, they can cause parsing errors or issues when setting environment variables. To avoid this, run the following command to convert the key to base64:

   ```bash
   cat private_key.pem | base64 -w 0
   ```

8. Add these environment variables with the values to your Plane instance's `.env` file.

   ```bash
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
   GITHUB_APP_NAME=<app_name>
   GITHUB_APP_ID=<app_id>
   GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>
   ```

9. Save the file and restart the instance.

10. Once you've completed the instance configuration, [activate the GitHub integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/github).
