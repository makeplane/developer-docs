This guide walks you through setting up a GitLab application to enable GitLab
integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted
environments don’t come pre-configured for GitLab, you’ll need to create an
application, configure authentication, and set the necessary permissions to ensure
seamless integration.

In this guide, you’ll:

1. [Create and configure a GitLab Application](#create-gitlab-application)
2. [Configure your Plane instance](#configure-plane-instance)

## Create GitLab Application

1. On the left sidebar in GitLab, select your avatar.
2. Select the **Preferences** tab.
3. Navigate to the **Applications** tab.
4. Click **Add new application** to begin setup.
   ![Add GitLab application](/images/integrations/gitlab/add-gitlab-application.webp)
5. Provide a **Name** for your application.
6. Enter the following **Redirect URI**, replacing [YOUR_DOMAIN] with your actual domain:
   ```bash
   https://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/silo/api/gitlab/auth/callback
   ```
7. You can choose to check or leave the **Confidential** box unchecked—both options work for Plane.

8. Set permissions by selecting the required **Scopes**. The table below explains each scope:

   | Permission         | Explanation                                                                                                                                                      |
   | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `api`              | Grants full read/write access to the API, including all groups, projects, container registry, dependency proxy, and package registry. Required for API requests. |
   | `read_api`         | Allows read-only access to all groups, projects, container registry, and package registry.                                                                       |
   | `read_user`        | Grants read-only access to user profiles via the /user API endpoint, including username, public email, and full name. Also provides access to /users endpoints.  |
   | `read_repository`  | Enables read-only access to repositories in private projects via Git-over-HTTP or the Repository Files API.                                                      |
   | `write_repository` | Allows read/write access to repositories on private projects via Git-over-HTTP (not through the API).                                                            |
   | `profile`          | Grants read-only access to the user's profile data using OpenID Connect.                                                                                         |
   | `email`            | Provides read-only access to the user's primary email address using OpenID Connect.                                                                              |

9. Click **Save Application** to finalize setup.

## Configure Plane instance

1. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the newly created application.
   ![Copy credentials](/images/integrations/gitlab/copy-credentials.webp)
2. Add these environment variables to your Plane instance's `.env` file:
   ```bash
   GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=<application_id>
   GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
   ```
3. Save the file and restart the instance.
4. Once you've completed the instance configuration, [activate the GitLab integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab).
