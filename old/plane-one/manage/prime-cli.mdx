<Warning>Update your CLI with the command `sudo prime-cli update-cli` before you download any Plane One updates. The latest version of the CLI ensures your Plane upgrades happen smoothly.</Warning>

The Prime CLI is our own command-line interface to help you install, upgrade, and manage your instance without being a pro at Docker. -

Bring up the Prime CLI with ```sudo prime-cli``` from any directory on your machine.

- The three operators you will use the most are,

    - `start`
    
        You will use this to start a service in the Docker network with the name of the service.

    - `stop`
    
        You will use this to stop a service in the Docker network with the name of the service.

    - `restart`
    
        You will use this to restart a service in the Docker network with the name of the service as a `{param or flag}`.
- Often, you will want to monitor the health of your instance and see if some services are up or down. Use `monitor` to do that.

- `healthcheck` is another useful utility that lets you see the status and errors, if any, of all running services

- `repair` fixes your Plane install for common errors automatically.

- `update-cli` downloads and installs the latest version of Prime CLI.
    <Tip>
    It is highly recommend to run this first before you download any Plane One updates. The latest version of the CLI ensures your Plane upgrades happen smoothly.

- `upgrade` 

    checks your instance for available version upgrades and asks you for a confirmation before downloading the latest available version.
        1. Typing `YES` lets the CLI automatically download's the latest version and installs it. Then it restarts the instance to load the latest app.
        2. Typing `NO` cancels the upgrade.

- `uninstall` 

    uninstalls Plane. Before it goes through, it asks you for a confirmation.
        1. Typing `YES` lets the CLI clean up the `/opt/plane` folder, leaving behind the `/opt/plane/data` and `/opt/plane/logs` folders.
        2. Typing `NO` cancels the uninstall.
