title: Google OAuth

Plane already ships with out-of-the-box support for Google OAuth. This is the easiest option to configure for Google Workspace users.

## Configure Plane as an app on Google API Console

First, you will need to identify Plane as an approved OAuth app to Google.

1. Go to the [Google API console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) and create a new project.
2. Navigate to the **OAuth consent screen** under **APIs & Services**. Choose how you want to configure and register the Plane app, including your target users, and click **Create**.

5. Select **Web application** under the **Application type** dropdown list. Update the following fields.
   1. **Authorized JavaScript origins**\
      The HTTP origins that host your web application, e.g., `https://app.plane.so`
   2. **Authorized redirect URIs**\
      Append the path that users should be redirected to after they have authenticated with Google. `https://<plane.example.com>/auth/google/callback` and `https://<plane.example.com>/auth/mobile/google/callback/` where `<plane.example.com>` is your self-hosted instance's domain.
   3. Click **Create**.
   4. Get the Client ID and Client secret under **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** on the **Credentials** screen.

## Configure Plane

1. Go to `Google` on the Authentication screen of `/god mode`.
2. Add the client ID + the client secret from Google API Console.
3. Click `Save `.

Your Plane instance should now work with `Sign in with Google`.
