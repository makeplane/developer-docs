The Prime CLI enables you to configure the Commercial edition instance, allowing customization of the PostgreSQL database, Redis, external storage, and other advanced settings.

1. From any directory on your machine, run the Prime CLI with:
    ```sudo prime-cli``` 

2. Once the CLI is running, enter `configure`, which will guide you through a step-by-step form where you can specify the following:
    
    - `Listening port`  
        Define the port for the built-in reverse proxy.  
        *Default*: `80`

    - `Max file-upload size`  
        Set the maximum file size (in MB) that can be uploaded to your Plane app.  
        *Default*: `5 MB`

    - `External Postgres URL`  
        Provide the URL of your external Postgres instance if you want to switch from the default Plane configuration.
        *Default*: `Postgres 15.5` in the Docker container

    - `External Redis URL`  
        Specify the URL of your external Redis instance to override the default Redis configuration.  
        *Default*: `Redis 7.2.4`

    - `External storage`   
       Plane currently supports only S3 compatible storages.  
       *Default*: `MinIO` 

       1. Ensure your IAM user has the following permissions on your S3 bucket.
            - **s3:GetObject**  
            To access the objects.
            - **s3:PutObject**  
            To upload new assets using the presigned url. 
        2. Configure the CORS policy on your bucket to enable presigned uploads. Use the example policy below, making sure to replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` with your actual domain.
            ```
            [
                {
                    "AllowedHeaders": [
                        "*"
                    ],
                    "AllowedMethods": [
                        "GET",
                        "POST",
                        "PUT",
                        "DELETE",
                        "HEAD"
                    ],
                    "AllowedOrigins": [
                        "<YOUR_DOMAIN>",
                    ],
                    "ExposeHeaders": [
                        "ETag",
                        "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
                        "x-amz-request-id",
                        "x-amz-id-2"
                    ],
                    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
                }
            ]
            ```
        3. Switch to your external storage by providing the following values:
            - S3 access key ID 
            - S3 secret access key
            - S3 bucket name
            - S3 region 
            - S3 endpoint URL

3. After confirming your choices, your instance will automatically restart with the updated configuration.
