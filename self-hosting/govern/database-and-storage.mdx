The Prime CLI enables you to configure the Commercial edition instance, allowing customization of the PostgreSQL database, Redis, external storage, and other advanced settings.

1. From any directory on your machine, run the Prime CLI with:
    ```sudo prime-cli``` 

2. Once the CLI is running, enter `configure`, which will guide you through a step-by-step form where you can specify the following:
    
    - `Listening port`  
        Define the port for the built-in reverse proxy.  
        *Default*: `80`

    - `Max file-upload size`  
        Set the maximum file size (in MB) that can be uploaded to your Plane app.  
        *Default*: `5 MB`

    - `External Postgres URL`  
        Provide the URL of your external Postgres instance if you want to switch from the default Plane configuration.
        *Default*: `Postgres 15.5` in the Docker container

    - `External Redis URL`  
        Specify the URL of your external Redis instance to override the default Redis configuration.  
        *Default*: `Redis 7.2.4`

    - `External storage`  
        Switch to your own storage by entering your AWS S3 credentials. Use the following format:
            - AWS Access Key ID
            - AWS Secret Access Key
            - AWS S3 Bucket Name    

        *Default*: `MinIO`
3. After confirming your choices, your instance will automatically restart with the updated configuration.
