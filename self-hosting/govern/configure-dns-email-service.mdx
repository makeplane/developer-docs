description: Configure DNS records to enable automatic conversion of incoming emails into work items in your project's Intake section.
---

This guide explains how to configure DNS settings to enable the [Intake Email](https://docs.plane.so/intake/intake-email) feature for your self-hosted Plane instance. These configurations enable your server to accept messages sent to your project's dedicated Intake address, which are then  converted into work items in your project's Intake section.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the Plane server allows inbound traffic on the following email-related ports: `25`, `465`, and `587`.

If any of these ports are currently in use, you can free them by running:

    ```bash
    fuser -k 25/tcp 465/tcp 587/tcp
    ```

## Generate SSL/TLS Certificate for Email Domain 
<Warning>
Mandatory for Docker Compose deployments only.
</Warning>
Before configuring DNS records for Intake Email, secure your email domain with an SSL/TLS certificate. This ensures encrypted communication between mail servers and improves email trust and deliverability.

1. **Install Certbot**   
Update your system and install Certbot.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install certbot
    ```
    For NGINX:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-certbot-nginx
    ```
    For Apache:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-certbot-apache
    ```

2. **Generate SSL Certificate**  
Choose the method that matches your web server setup:

    For NGINX:
    ```bash
    sudo certbot --nginx -d <mail-domain>
    ```

    For Apache:
    ```bash
    sudo certbot --apache -d <mail-domain>
    ```

    For standalone (no web server):
    ```bash
    sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d <mail-domain>
    ```

3. **Copy Certificate Files**  
Copy the generated certificate files to Plane's expected directory:

    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<mail-domain>/fullchain.pem /opt/plane/data/email/tls/cert.pem 
    sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<mail-domain>/privkey.pem /opt/plane/data/email/tls/key.pem
    ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**  
Add the following settings to your plane.env file:

    ```bash
    # If using SMTP_DOMAIN as FQDN (e.g., intake.example.com),
    # generate a valid SSL certificate and set these paths accordingly.
    SMTP_DOMAIN=intake.example.com
    TLS_CERT_PATH=tls/cert.pem
    TLS_PRIV_KEY_PATH=tls/key.pem
    INTAKE_EMAIL_DOMAIN=intake.example.com
    ```

    <Warning>
    Important: `SMTP_DOMAIN` and `INTAKE_EMAIL_DOMAIN` must be identical.
    </Warning>


## Configure DNS records

1. **Create an A Record**  
This record points to the server running your email service.

    ```bash
    Type: A
    Host: <host-domain>           # Example: plane.example.com
    Value: <public-ip-address>    # Your server's public IP address
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ``` 

    <Tip> 
    You can alternatively use a CNAME record if you're using a cloud load balancer.
    </Tip>

2. **Add an MX Record**  
This record directs email traffic to your mail server.
    ```bash
    Type: MX
    Host: <mail-domain>           # Example: intake.example.com
    Value: <host-domain>          # Same as your A record host
    Priority: 10
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ```

3. **Configure an SPF Record**  
This record helps prevent email spoofing.

    ```bash
    Type: TXT
    Host: <mail-domain>           # Example: intake.example.com
    Value: "v=spf1 ip4:<A-record-ip-host-domain> -all"
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ``` 
4. **Set Up a DMARC record**  
This record specifies how receiving mail servers should handle authentication failures.

    ```bash
    Type: TXT
    Host: _dmarc.<mail-domain>    # Example: _dmarc.intake.example.com
    Value: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:<valid-email-addr>"
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ```
## Verify your configuration
After setting up your DNS records, verify that they're correctly configured:

    ```bash
    # Verify A record
    dig A <mail-domain>

    # Verify MX record
    dig MX <mail-domain>

    # Verify SPF record
    dig TXT <mail-domain>

    # Verify DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.<mail-domain>
    ```

    You can also use [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com) to check for any issues with your DNS configuration.

## Test your mail server
Once your DNS records have propagated, test your SMTP connections:

    ```bash
    # Test SMTP connection on standard ports
    telnet <host-domain> 25
    telnet <host-domain> 465
    telnet <host-domain> 587
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- MX Record issues

    - Ensure there's a proper dot at the end of the domain.
    - Check that the priority number is correct (lower = higher priority).
    - Allow 24-48 hours for DNS changes to fully propagate.

- A Record issues

    - Verify that the IP address is correct.
    - Ensure your mail subdomain matches the MX record.
