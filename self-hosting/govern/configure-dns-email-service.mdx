description: Configure DNS records to enable automatic conversion of incoming emails into work items in your project's Intake section.
---

This guide explains how to configure DNS settings to enable the [Intake Email](https://docs.plane.so/intake/intake-email) feature for your self-hosted Plane instance. These configurations enable your server to accept messages sent to your project's dedicated Intake address, which are then  converted into work items in your project's Intake section.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that the Plane server allows outbound traffic on the following email-related ports: 25, 465, and 587.

If any of these ports are currently in use, you can free them by running:

    ```bash
    fuser -k 25/tcp 465/tcp 587/tcp
    ```

This is necessary for email functionality (e.g., sending invites, notifications) to work properly.

## Configure DNS records

1. **Create an A Record**  
This record points to the server running your email service.

    ```bash
    Type: A
    Host: <host-domain>           # Example: plane.example.com
    Value: <public-ip-address>    # Your server's public IP address
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ``` 

    <Tip> 
    You can alternatively use a CNAME record if you're using a cloud load balancer.
    </Tip>

2. **Add an MX Record**  
This record directs email traffic to your mail server.
    ```bash
    Type: MX
    Host: <mail-domain>           # Example: intake.example.com
    Value: <host-domain>          # Same as your A record host
    Priority: 10
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ```

3. **Configure an SPF Record**  
This record helps prevent email spoofing.

    ```bash
    Type: TXT
    Host: <mail-domain>           # Example: intake.example.com
    Value: "v=spf1 ip4:<A-record-ip-host-domain> -all"
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ``` 
4. **Set Up a DMARC record**  
This record specifies how receiving mail servers should handle authentication failures.

    ```bash
    Type: TXT
    Host: _dmarc.<mail-domain>    # Example: _dmarc.intake.example.com
    Value: "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:<valid-email-addr>"
    TTL: Auto | 3600
    ```
## Verify your configuration
After setting up your DNS records, verify that they're correctly configured:

    ```bash
    # Verify A record
    dig A <mail-domain>

    # Verify MX record
    dig MX <mail-domain>

    # Verify SPF record
    dig TXT <mail-domain>

    # Verify DMARC record
    dig TXT _dmarc.<mail-domain>
    ```

    You can also use [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com) to check for any issues with your DNS configuration.

## Test your mail server
Once your DNS records have propagated, test your SMTP connections:

    ```bash
    # Test SMTP connection on standard ports
    telnet <host-domain> 25
    telnet <host-domain> 465
    telnet <host-domain> 587
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- MX Record issues

    - Ensure there's a proper dot at the end of the domain.
    - Check that the priority number is correct (lower = higher priority).
    - Allow 24-48 hours for DNS changes to fully propagate.

- A Record issues

    - Verify that the IP address is correct.
    - Ensure your mail subdomain matches the MX record.
