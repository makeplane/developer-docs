title : Configure Slack App for Plane integration
sidebarTitle: Slack
---

This guide walks you through setting up a Slack App to enable Slack integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted environments don’t come pre-configured for Slack, you’ll need to set up the necessary authentication, permissions, and event subscriptions to ensure seamless communication between Plane and Slack.

In this guide, you’ll:
1. [Create and configure a Slack App](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/slack#create-slack-app)
2. [Configure your Plane instance](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/slack#configure-plane-instance)

<Warning>
**Activate Slack integration**

After creating and configuring the Slack app and configuring the instance as detailed on this page, you'll need to [set up the Slack integration](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/slack) within Plane. 
</Warning>

## Create Slack App

To configure Slack integration, you'll need to create a Slack App within your organization. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) on Slack.

2. Click **Create an App**.

3. Choose **From a manifest**.
    ![Choose Manifest](/images/integrations/slack/choose-from-manifest.webp)

4. Select the workspace where you want the app installed.

5. Remove the default manifest and paste the one below, making sure to update the placeholders with your actual values.

### Manifest reference

The manifest file defines the configuration for integrating Plane with Slack. It requests access to several features, enabling Plane to interact with Slack efficiently.

#### Features

| Feature | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `bot_user` | Required to send thread messages while syncing issues or sending Plane notifications to Slack.|
| `slack_commands` | A Slack command (`/plane`) allows users to create issues directly from Slack using a slash command. |
| `shortcuts` | After activation, users can create issues from messages inside Slack.|
| `unfurl_domain` | Specifies the domain where Plane is hosted. When an issue, cycle, or module link is pasted in Slack, it generates a preview of the entity. |

#### Variables

|Variable|Explanation|
|------------|--------|
|`YOUR_DOMAIN`|The domain where Plane is hosted. This is required for sending webhook events and authentication callbacks.|
|`YOUR_APP_NAME`|The name you want to give your Slack app. "Plane" is a good default option.|
|`YOUR_APP_DESCRIPTION`|A short description of your Slack app’s purpose.|

#### Event subscription

For thread sync and link unfurling to work, event subscriptions must be enabled. These events send relevant activity to Plane.

| Bot event | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `link_shared` | When a link is shared in Slack and its hostname matches `unfurl_domain`, Plane receives the event and generates a preview of the entity. |
| `message_channels` | When a message is posted in a channel, an event is triggered in Plane to support thread sync. |
| `message_im` | When a direct message (DM) is posted, an event is triggered in Plane to support thread sync. |

#### User permissions

| Permission | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `chat:write` | Allows the bot to send messages in channels and conversations it is a member of. |
| `identify` | Allows the bot to verify its own identity and retrieve basic information. |
| `im:read` | Enables the bot to view direct messages (DMs) where it has been added. |
| `im:write` | Allows the bot to send direct messages (DMs) to users. |
| `links:write` | Permits the bot to add, edit, and remove link unfurls. |
| `links:read` | Allows the bot to view link unfurls and associated metadata. |

#### Bot permissions

| Permission | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `channels:join` | Allows the bot to join public channels. |
| `channels:read` | Permits viewing public channel information and members. |
| `users:read` | Allows viewing user information and presence status. |
| `users:read.email` | Enables access to users' email addresses. |
| `chat:write` | Allows sending messages in channels and conversations. |
| `chat:write.customize` | Enables customization of the bot's name and profile when sending messages. |
| `channels:history` | Allows viewing message history in public channels. |
| `groups:history` | Permits viewing message history in private channels. |
| `mpim:history` | Enables access to message history in multi-person direct messages. |
| `im:history` | Allows viewing message history in direct messages. |
| `links:read` | Permits viewing link unfurls and associated metadata. |
| `links:write` | Allows adding, editing, and removing link unfurls. |
| `groups:read` | Enables viewing private channel information and members. |
| `im:read` | Allows viewing direct messages where the bot is added. |
| `mpim:read` | Permits viewing multi-person direct messages. |
| `reactions:read` | Enables viewing emoji reactions on messages. |
| `reactions:write` | Allows adding and removing emoji reactions. |
| `files:read` | Permits viewing and downloading files. |
| `files:write` | Enables uploading, editing, and deleting files. |
| `im:write` | Allows sending direct messages to users. |
| `commands` | Enables the bot to add and respond to slash commands. |

## Configure Plane instance
After creating your Slack app, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the **Event Subscriptions** tab.

2. Click **Retry** to verify your event subscription URL.
    ![Event subscriptions](/images/integrations/slack/event-subscriptions.webp)

3. Navigate to the **Basic Information** tab on Slack to find your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

4. Add these environment variables with the values to your Plane instance's `.env` file.
    ```bash
    SLACK_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
    SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
    ```
5. Save the file and restart the instance. 

6. Once you've completed the instance configuration, [activate the Slack integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/slack).
