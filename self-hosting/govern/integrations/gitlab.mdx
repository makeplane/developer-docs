title : Configure GitLab Application for Plane integration
sidebarTitle: GitLab
---

This guide walks you through setting up a GitLab application to enable GitLab integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted environments don’t come pre-configured for GitLab, you’ll need to create an application, configure authentication, and set the necessary permissions to ensure seamless integration.

This guide covers configuration for both:

- **[GitLab.com](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab?edition=gitlab-cloud#create-gitlab-application)**   
The standard cloud-hosted GitLab service

- **[GitLab Self-managed](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab?edition=gitlab-self-managed#create-gitlab-application)**   
Self-hosted GitLab instances for organizations with specific compliance or security requirements

In this guide, you’ll:

1. [Create and configure a GitLab Application](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab#create-gitlab-application)
2. [Configure your Plane instance](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab#configure-plane-instance)

<Warning>
**Activate GitLab integration**

After creating and configuring the GitLab application and configuring the instance as detailed on this page, you'll need to [setup the GitLab integration](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab) within Plane. 
</Warning>

## Create GitLab Application

<Tabs>
<Tab title="GitLab Cloud">
    1. On the left sidebar in GitLab, select your avatar.

    2. Select **Preferences** tab.

    3. Navigate to the **Applications** tab.

    4. Click on **Add new application** to begin the setup.
        ![Add GitLab application](/images/integrations/gitlab/add-gitlab-application.webp)

    5. Provide a **Name** for your application.

    6. Enter the following **Redirect URI**, replacing [YOUR_DOMAIN] with your actual domain:
        ```bash
        https://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/silo/api/gitlab/auth/callback
        ```
    7. You can choose to check or leave the **Confidential** box unchecked—both options work for Plane.

        ![Add app details](/images/integrations/gitlab/add-app-details.webp)

    8. Set permissions by selecting the required **Scopes**. The table below explains each scope:

        |Permission|Explanation|
        |----------|-----------|
        |`api`|Grants full read/write access to the API, including all groups, projects, container registry, dependency proxy, and package registry. Required for API requests.|
        |`read_api`|Allows read-only access to all groups, projects, container registry, and package registry.|
        |`read_user`|Grants read-only access to user profiles via the /user API endpoint, including username, public email, and full name. Also provides access to /users endpoints.|
        |`read_repository`|Enables read-only access to repositories in private projects via Git-over-HTTP or the Repository Files API.|
        |`write_repository`|Allows read/write access to repositories on private projects via Git-over-HTTP (not through the API).|
        |`profile`|Grants read-only access to the user's profile data using OpenID Connect.|
        |`email`|Provides read-only access to the user's primary email address using OpenID Connect.|

    9. Click **Save Application** to finalize the setup.
</Tab>

<Tab title="GitLab Self-managed">
1. Log in to your GitLab instance.
2. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
3. From the dropdown menu that appears, select **Edit profile**.
4. Look for and select the **Applications** option within this menu.

![GitLab Applications](https://media.docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab/gitlab-applications.webp#center)

5. On the Applications page, click **Add new application** to begin configuring your OAuth application.

Fill in the application details with the following configuration:

    - **Name**  
    Enter a descriptive name for your application (e.g., `Plane Local Dev` or `Plane Integration`).

    - **Redirect URI**  
    The redirect URI depends on your Plane deployment:

        **For Plane Cloud:**
        ```
        https://silo.plane.so/api/oauth/gitlab-enterprise/auth/callback
        ```

        **For Plane Self-Hosted:**
        ```
        https://<your-domain>/silo/api/oauth/gitlab-enterprise/auth/callback
        ```

    Replace `<your-domain>` with your actual Plane instance domain.

    - **Confidential**  
    Keep the **Confidential** checkbox enabled. This ensures the application uses a client secret for secure authentication.

    - **Scopes**  
    Select the following scopes to grant Plane the necessary permissions:

        - **api** - Grants complete read/write access to the API, including all groups and projects
        - **read_api** - Grants read access to the API, including all groups and projects
        - **read_user** - Grants read-only access to your profile information
        - **read_repository** - Grants read-only access to repositories on private projects
        - **profile** - Grants read-only access to the user's profile data using OpenID Connect
        - **email** - Grants read-only access to the user's primary email address using OpenID Connect

6. Click **Save application** to create the OAuth application.

## Configure Plane instance

<Tabs>
<Tab title="GitLab Cloud">

1. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the newly created application.
    ![Copy credentials](/images/integrations/gitlab/copy-credentials.webp)

2. Add these environment variables with the values to your Plane instance's `.env` file. 

    ```bash
    GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=<application_id>
    GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
    ```
3. Save the file and restart the instance. 

4. Once you've completed the instance configuration, [activate the GitLab integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab?edition=gitlab-cloud).

</Tab>

<Tab title="GitLab Self-managed">

1. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the newly created application.
