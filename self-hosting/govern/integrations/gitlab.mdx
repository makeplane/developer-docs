title : Configure GitLab Application for Plane integration
sidebarTitle: GitLab
---

This guide walks you through setting up a GitLab application to enable GitLab integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted environments don’t come pre-configured for GitLab, you’ll need to create an application, configure authentication, and set the necessary permissions to ensure seamless integration.

In this guide, you’ll:

1. [Create and configure a GitLab Application](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab#create-a-gitlab-application)
2. [Configure your Plane instance](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/gitlab#configure-plane-instance)

## Create GitLab Application

1. On the left sidebar in GitLab, select your avatar.

2. Select **Preferences** tab.

3. Navigate to the **Applications** tab.

4. Click on **Add new application** to begin the setup.
    ![Add GitLab application](/images/integrations/gitlab/add-gitlab-application.webp)

5. Provide a **Name** for your application.

6. Enter the following **Redirect URI**, replacing [YOUR_DOMAIN] with your actual domain:
    ```bash
    https://[YOUR_DOMAIN]/silo/api/gitlab/auth/callback
    ```
7. You can choose to check or leave the **Confidential** box unchecked—both options work for Plane.

8. Set permissions by selecting the required **Scopes**. The table below explains each scope:

    |Permission|Explanation|
    |----------|-----------|
    |`api`|Grants full read/write access to the API, including all groups, projects, container registry, dependency proxy, and package registry. Required for API requests.|
    |`read_api`|Allows read-only access to all groups, projects, container registry, and package registry.|
    |`read_user`|Grants read-only access to user profiles via the /user API endpoint, including username, public email, and full name. Also provides access to /users endpoints.|
    |`read_repository`|Enables read-only access to repositories in private projects via Git-over-HTTP or the Repository Files API.|
    |`write_repository`|Allows read/write access to repositories on private projects via Git-over-HTTP (not through the API).|
    |`profile`|Grants read-only access to the user's profile data using OpenID Connect.|
    |`email`|Provides read-only access to the user's primary email address using OpenID Connect.|

9. Click **Save Application** to finalize the setup.

## Configure Plane instance

1. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the newly created application.
    ![Copy credentials](/images/integrations/gitlab/copy-credentials.webp)

2. Add these environment variables with the values to your Plane instance's `.env` file. 

    ```bash
    GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=<application_id>
    GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
    ```
3. Save the file and restart the instance. 

4. Once you've completed the instance configuration, [activate the GitLab integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/gitlab).
