title : Configure GitHub App for Plane integration
sidebarTitle: GitHub
---

This guide walks you through setting up a GitHub App to enable GitHub integration for your Plane workspace on a self-hosted instance. Since self-hosted environments don’t come pre-configured for GitHub, you’ll need to set up the necessary authentication, permissions, and webhooks to ensure smooth integration.

This guide covers configuration for both:

- **[GitHub Cloud](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github?edition=github-cloud#create-github-app)**   
The standard cloud-hosted GitHub service

- **[GitHub Enterprise Server](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github?edition=github-enterprise#create-github-app)**   
Self-hosted GitHub instances for organizations with specific compliance or security requirements

In this guide, you’ll:
1. [Create and configure a GitHub App](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#create-github-app)
2. [Set up permissions and events](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#set-up-permissions-and-events)
3. [Configure your Plane instance](/self-hosting/govern/integrations/github#configure-plane-instance)

<Warning>
**Activate GitHub integration**

After creating and configuring the GitHub app and configuring the instance as detailed on this page, you'll need to [setup the GitHub integration](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/github) within Plane. 
</Warning>

## Create GitHub App

To configure GitHub integration, you'll need to create a GitHub App within your organization.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="GitHub Cloud">
 1. Go to **Settings \> Developer Settings \> GitHub Apps** in your GitHub organization.

   2. Click **New GitHub App**.
         ![Create GitHub App](/images/integrations/github/create-github-app.webp)

   3. In the **Register new GitHub App** page, provide a **GitHub App name** and **Homepage URL**.
         ![App name and homepage URL](/images/integrations/github/app-name-homepage-url.webp)

   4. In the **Identifying and authorizing users** section, add the following **Callback URLS**.

      ```bash
      https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/callback
      https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/user/callback
      ```

      These URLs allow Plane to verify and enable workspace connection with the Github App.
      ![Add Callback URL](/images/integrations/github/add-callback-url.webp)

5. In the **Post installation** section, add the below **Setup URL**.

         ```bash
         https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/auth/callback
         ```

         Redirects users to this URL after GitHub app installation.
         ![Add setup URL](/images/integrations/github/add-setup-url.webp)

      6. Turn on **Redirect on update**.

      7. In the **Webhook** section, add the below **Webhook URL**.

         ```bash
         https://<your-domain>/silo/api/github/github-webhook
         ```

         This allows Plane to receive updates from GitHub repositories.

         ![Add Webhook URL](/images/integrations/github/add-webhook-url.webp)
</Tab>

<Tab title="GitHub Enterprise Server">

1. Go to **Settings \> Developer Settings \> GitHub Apps** in your GitHub organization.

      2. Click **New GitHub App**.
         ![Create GitHub App](/images/integrations/github/create-github-app.webp)

      3. In the **Register new GitHub App** page, provide a **GitHub App name** and **Homepage URL**.
         ![App name and homepage URL](/images/integrations/github/app-name-homepage-url.webp)

      4. In the **Identifying and authorizing users** section, add the following **Callback URLS**. 

            **For Plane cloud instance**  

               ```bash
               https://silo.plane.so/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/callback
               https://silo.plane.so/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/user/callback
               ```

            **For Plane self-hosted instance**  

               ```bash
               https://<your-domain>/silo/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/callback
               https://<your-domain>/silo/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/user/callback
               ```
            
         These URLs allow Plane to verify and enable workspace connection with the Github App.
         ![Add Callback URL](/images/integrations/github/add-callback-url.webp)

      5. In the **Post installation** section, add the below **Setup URL**.  

            **For Plane cloud instance**  
            ```bash
            https://silo.plane.so/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/callback
            ```

            **For Plane self-hosted instance**  

            ```bash
            https://<your-plane-domain>/silo/api/oauth/github-enterprise/auth/callback
            ```
         Redirects users to this URL after GitHub app installation.
         ![Add setup URL](/images/integrations/github/add-setup-url.webp)

      6. Turn on **Redirect on update**.

      7. In the **Webhook** section, add the below **Webhook URL**.  

            **For Plane cloud instance**  
            ```bash
            https://silo.plane.so/api/github-enterprise/github-webhook
            ```

            **For Plane self-hosted instance**

            ```bash
            https://<your-plane-domain>/silo/api/github-enterprise/github-webhook
            ```
         This allows Plane to receive updates from GitHub repositories.

3. Click the **Create GitHub App** button at the bottom of the page.

## Configure Plane instance

<Tabs>
<Tab title="GitHub Cloud">
1. Go back to **Settings \> Developer Settings \> GitHub Apps**.

2. Click **Edit** on the GitHub you created.

3. In the **General** tab, under the **Client secrets** section, click **Generate a new client secret**.

   ![General tab](/images/integrations/github/general-tab.webp)

4. Scroll down to the **Private keys** section.

   ![Private keys](/images/integrations/github/private-keys.webp)

5. Click **Genereate a private key**.

6. Retrieve the following details from the **General** tab:
   - App ID
   - Client ID
   - Client secret
   - GitHub App name
   - Private key

7. Before adding the Private key as an environment variable, you’ll need to convert it to base64. Since private keys are typically multi-line, they can cause parsing errors or issues when setting environment variables. To avoid this, run the following command to convert the key to base64:

   ```bash
   cat private_key.pem | base64 -w 0
   ```

8. Add these environment variables with the values to your Plane instance's `.env` file.

   ```bash
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
   GITHUB_APP_NAME=<app_name>
   GITHUB_APP_ID=<app_id>
   GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>
   ```

9. Save the file and restart the instance.

10. Once you've completed the instance configuration, [activate the GitHub integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/github).

</Tab>

<Tab title="GitHub Enterprise Server">

    - Private key
    
7. Convert the Private key to convert it to base64. Since private keys are typically multi-line, they can cause parsing errors or issues when setting environment variables. To avoid this, run the following command to convert the key to base64:
    ```bash
    cat private_key.pem | base64 -w 0
    ```

8. Once you've created the app, [activate the GitHub Enterprise integration in Plane](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/github?edition=github-enterprise#connect-github-organization).
