    Error: Failed to update Prime CLI, please contact support or try again later.
</div>

This error typically happens if you're using an older version of the Prime CLI. To fix it, follow these steps:

1. Start by taking a [data backup](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore#backup-data) to be safe.
2. Run this command to remove the existing CLI:
    ```bash
    rm -rf /usr/bin/prime-cli
    ```
3. Install the latest version of the CLI with:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/install/ | sh
    ```
