Backing up your data regularly helps prevent data loss and allows you to restore your system quickly if necessary. Follow these instructions to back up and restore your data using Plane’s command-line interface.

## Backup data
Create a backup of your Plane data with ↓:
```bash
sudo prime-cli backup
```

This command initiates a full backup of all critical data, storing it in the default backup location at:
```bash
/opt/plane/backups
```
Each backup file will be timestamped to ensure you can easily identify the latest or a specific backup if needed.

## Restore data

You can restore your data from a previous backup with ↓:
```bash
sudo prime-cli restore
```

This command prompts the restoration process, which will overwrite the current data with the data from the most recent backup file. Ensure you have selected the correct backup before running this command, as restoring will replace your current data.

## Backup data

To create a backup, start by running the setup script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```
You’ll see a menu of options—just type 7 to select "Backup Data."

```
Select an Action you want to perform:
   1) Install (x86_64)
   2) Start
   3) Stop
   4) Restart
   5) Upgrade
   6) View Logs
   7) Backup Data
   8) Exit

Action [2]: 7
```
The system will start backing up the PostgreSQL, Redis, and upload data:

```
Backing Up plane-app_pgdata
Backing Up plane-app_redisdata
Backing Up plane-app_uploads

Backup completed successfully. Backup files are stored in /....../plane-app/backup/20240502-1120
```
The backup files are stored locally, so you can copy them to an external storage service if needed for extra security.

## Restore data
Follow these steps to restore data from a backup:

1. Make sure Plane-CE is installed and started, then stop it. This ensures the necessary Docker volumes are ready.

2. Use the command ↓ to download the restore script. It’s easiest to save it in the same directory as `setup.sh`.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL -o restore.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/master/deploy/selfhost/restore.sh
    chmod +x restore.sh
    ```

3. Now, run the command ↓ to restore your data, specifying the path to your backup folder (the folder with the `*.tar.gz` files):

    ```bash
    ./restore.sh <path to backup folder containing *.tar.gz files>
    ```

    Here’s an example output for restoring from /opt/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240722-0914:

    ```bash

    ```

4. Start your Plane instance again with ↓:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh start
    ```

That’s it! You’re back up and running with your restored data.
