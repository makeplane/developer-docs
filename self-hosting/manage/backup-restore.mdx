## Restore data

When you want to restore the previously backed-up data, follow the instructions below.

1. Make sure that Plane-CE is installed, started, and then stopped. This ensures that the Docker volumes are created.

2. Download the restore script using the command below. We suggest downloading it in the same folder as setup.sh.

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL -o restore.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/master/deploy/selfhost/restore.sh
    chmod +x restore.sh
    ```

3. Execute the command below to restore your data.

    ```bash
    ./restore.sh <path to backup folder containing *.tar.gz files>
    ```

    As an example, for a backup folder /opt/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240722-0914, expect the response below:

    ```bash
        --------------------------------------------
