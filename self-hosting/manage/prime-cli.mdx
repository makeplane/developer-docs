Our command-line tool is here to make managing your Plane instance simple. You can handle installs, upgrades, and general management without needing to be a Docker expert.


## Prime CLI • Commercial Edition
<Note>
If you are on the Community edition and want to upgrade to the Commercial edition, see [Upgrade to Commercial Edition](/self-hosting/upgrade-from-community).
</Note>

The Prime CLI provides commands for common tasks like configuring services, monitoring health, managing backups, and upgrading your Plane instance.

Bring up the Prime CLI with ```sudo prime-cli``` from any directory on your machine.

- The three operators you will use the most are:

    - `start`
    
        You will use this to start a service in the Docker network with the name of the service.

    - `stop`
    
        You will use this to stop a service in the Docker network with the name of the service.

    - `restart`
    
        You will use this to restart a service in the Docker network with the name of the service as a `{param or flag}`.
- Often, you will want to monitor the health of your instance and see if some services are up or down. Use `monitor` to do that.

- `healthcheck` is another useful utility that lets you see the status and errors, if any, of all running services

- `repair` automatically diagnoses and fixes common errors in your Plane instance. This command also resets all configuration values in the plane.env file to their defaults. 

- `update-cli` downloads and installs the latest version of Prime CLI.
    <Tip>
    It is highly recommend to run this first before you download any Plane updates. The latest version of the CLI ensures your Plane upgrades happen smoothly.
    </Tip>

For more advanced admins that want greater control over their instance, the list of additional commands available on Prime CLI follow.
    - `configure` 
    
        Brings up a step form to let you specify the following.
        <Accordion title="Steps to configure your instance">
            - `Listening port`
            
                Specify the port that the built-in reverse proxy will use

                Default value: 80

            - `Max file-upload size`
            
                Specify a size in MBs for how big each file uploaded to your Plane app can be

                Default value: 5 MB

            - `External Postgres URL`
            
                Specify the URL of your own hosted Postgres if you would like to change the database your Plane app uses.
        
                Default database: Postgres 15.5 in the Docker container

            - `External Redis URL`
            
                Specify the URL of your own hosted REdis if you would like to change the default Redis Plane ships with.

                Default Redis: Redis 7.2.4

            - `External storage`
            
                Specify your AWS S3 bucket's credentials in the format below to change storage from the default Plane ships with.
                    - AWS Access Key ID
                    - AWS Secret Access Key
                    - AWS S3 Bucket Name
        
                        Default storage: MinIO
            
                - Confirm your choices on the screen ↓. 

                    This restarts your instance with the new configs.
        </Accordion>

- `upgrade` 

    checks your instance for available version upgrades and asks you for a confirmation before downloading the latest available version.
        1. Typing `YES` lets the CLI automatically download's the latest version and installs it. Then it restarts the instance to load the latest app.
        2. Typing `NO` cancels the upgrade.

- `uninstall` 

    uninstalls Plane. Before it goes through, it asks you for a confirmation.
        1. Typing `YES` lets the CLI clean up the `/opt/plane` folder, leaving behind the `/opt/plane/data` and `/opt/plane/logs` folders.
        2. Typing `NO` cancels the uninstall.
