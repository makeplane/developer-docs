Keeping Plane up to date ensures you’re using the latest features, improvements, and security fixes. Here’s how to upgrade your Plane installation with a single command.

<Note>
The upgrade process may involve a brief downtime as services are updated and restarted.
</Note>

## Prerequisites
We recommend creating a backup of your data before any major upgrade. See [Backup and restore data](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore).

## Update version

1. Update your Prime CLI with the command ↓:
   ```bash
   sudo prime-cli update-cli
   ``` 
   The latest version of the CLI ensures your Plane upgrades happen smoothly.

2. To update Plane to the latest version, run:
   ```bash
   sudo prime-cli upgrade
   ```
   This command checks for the latest version of Plane and applies the upgrade if a new version is available.

Keeping Plane up to date helps you stay on top of the latest features and improvements. 

<Warning>
This guide covers how to upgrade from version 0.14.0 and above. If you’re running version 0.13.2 or below, first follow the guide to upgrade to v0.14.0 at the bottom of this section before continuing with these steps.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make a backup of your Plane instance. For detailed steps, see the [Backup and restore data](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore#backup-data) section. This is strongly recommended to ensure you have a safe restore point.

## Update version

1. Execute the setup script with ↓:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This will bring up a menu with several options. Select option `5` to upgrade:

   ```bash
   Select a Action you want to perform:
      1) Install (x86_64)
      2) Start
      3) Stop
      4) Restart
      5) Upgrade
      6) View Logs
      7) Backup Data
      8) Exit

   Action [2]: 5
   ```
   Choosing this option stops all services and downloads the latest `docker-compose.yaml` and `variables-upgrade.env` files. The `plane.env` file won’t be overwritten, so your existing environment settings are safe.

   You’ll see a message indicating the services have been stopped.

2. After the update completes, select `6` to exit the prompt.

3. After the upgrade, open `variables-upgrade.env` and compare it with your `plane.env` file. Copy any new variables from `variables-upgrade.env` to your `plane.env` file and set the correct values. This step is essential to ensure that all configuration changes are in place for the latest version.

4. Once your `plane.env` file is updated, start your Plane instance again by selecting option `2`.

### Upgrade from v0.13.2 to v0.14.0

If you’re upgrading from `v0.13.2`, there are some additional migration steps due to significant changes in the self-hosting setup. Follow these instructions to migrate your data to the new volume structure in `v0.14.0`.

1. First, start and then stop Plane in version `0.14.0` to initialize the new Docker volumes.

2. Use the following command to download the migration script:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL -o migrate.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/master/deploy/selfhost/migration-0.13-0.14.sh
   ```

3. Make the file executable.
   ```bash
   chmod +x migrate.sh
   ```

4. Run the migration script: 
   ```bash
   ./migrate.sh
   ```

   You’ll see the following instructions:

   ```
   ******************************************************************

   This script is solely for the migration purpose only.
   This is a 1 time migration of volume data from v0.13.2 => v0.14.x

   Assumption:
   1. Postgres data volume name ends with _pgdata
   2. Minio data volume name ends with _uploads
   3. Redis data volume name ends with _redisdata

   Any changes to this script can break the migration.

   Before you proceed, make sure you run the below command
   to know the docker volumes

   docker volume ls -q | grep -i "_pgdata"
   docker volume ls -q | grep -i "_uploads"
   docker volume ls -q | grep -i "_redisdata"

   *******************************************************

   Given below list of REDIS volumes, identify the prefix of source and destination volumes leaving "_redisdata"
   ---------------------
   plane-app_redisdata
   v0132_redisdata

   Provide the Source Volume Prefix :
   ```

5. Open a second terminal and run the commands shown above to identify your source and destination volume prefixes. For example, you might see something like:
   ```bash
   plane-app_redisdata
   v0132_redisdata
   ```

   In this example, `v0132` is the prefix for `v0.13.2`, and `plane-app` is the prefix for `v0.14.0`.

6. Return to the original terminal, enter the source volume prefix `v0132` and destination volume prefix `plane-app`, and press ENTER:
   ```bash
   Provide the Source Volume Prefix : v0132
   Provide the Destination Volume Prefix : plane-app
   ```

   If there are any issues, an error will appear. For a successful migration, there will be no error, and the process will exit quietly.

7. Restart the upgraded v0.14.0 instance.
