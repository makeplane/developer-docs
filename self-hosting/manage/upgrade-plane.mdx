Keeping Plane up to date ensures you’re using the latest features, improvements, and security fixes. Here’s how to upgrade your Plane installation with a single command.

<Note>
The upgrade process may involve a brief downtime as services are updated and restarted.

## Prerequisites
We recommend creating a backup of your data before any version updates. See [Backup data](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore).

## Check version

You can quickly check your Plane version by clicking the **?** icon on the sidebar.

## Update version

1. Update your Prime CLI with the command ↓:
   ```bash
   sudo prime-cli update-cli
   ``` 
   The latest version of the CLI ensures your Plane upgrades happen smoothly.

2. To update Plane to the latest version, run:
   ```bash
   sudo prime-cli upgrade
   ```
   This command checks for the latest version of Plane and applies the upgrade if a new version is available.

<Warning>
This guide covers how to upgrade from version 0.14.0 and above. If you’re running version 0.13.2 or below, first follow the guide to [upgrade to version v0.14.0](/self-hosting/manage/upgrade-from-0.13.2-0.14.0) before continuing with these steps.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make a backup of your Plane instance. For detailed steps, see the [Backup data](/self-hosting/manage/backup-restore#community-edition) section. This is strongly recommended to ensure you have a safe restore point.

## Update version

1. Download the latest stable release with ↓:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makeplane/plane/master/deploy/selfhost/install.sh
    ```

2. Execute the setup script with ↓:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This will bring up a menu with several options. Select option `5` to upgrade:

   ```bash
   Select a Action you want to perform:
      1) Install (x86_64)
      2) Start
      3) Stop
      4) Restart
      5) Upgrade
      6) View Logs
      7) Backup Data
      8) Exit

   Action [2]: 5
   ```
   Choosing this option stops all services and downloads the latest `docker-compose.yaml` and `variables-upgrade.env` files. The `plane.env` file won’t be overwritten, so your existing environment settings are safe.

   You’ll see a message indicating the services have been stopped.

3. After the update completes, select `6` to exit the prompt.

4. After the upgrade, open `variables-upgrade.env` and compare it with your `plane.env` file. Copy any new variables from `variables-upgrade.env` to your `plane.env` file and set the correct values. This step is essential to ensure that all configuration changes are in place for the latest version.

5. Once your `plane.env` file is updated, start your Plane instance again by selecting option `2`.
