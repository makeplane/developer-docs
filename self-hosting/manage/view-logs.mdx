If you need to check the logs for troubleshooting or to monitor what’s happening in specific Plane services like the API or Worker, you can access them directly from the command line.

To view logs, start by running the command ↓:
   ```bash
   sudo prime-cli monitor
   ```

This brings up a table where you can select which container logs you want to view.

Here’s how to view logs for any service in Plane Community Edition, whether it’s the API, Worker, Redis, or others. This can be really helpful when troubleshooting or just getting insights into how each service is running.

1. Start by running the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   This will bring up the main menu with options. Select `6` to view logs.

   ```
   Select a Action you want to perform:
      1) Install (x86_64)
      2) Start
      3) Stop
      4) Restart
      5) Upgrade
      6) View Logs
      7) Backup Data
      8) Exit

   Action [2]: 6
   ```
2. After choosing `6`, you’ll see a sub-menu listing all available services:

   ```
   Select a Service you want to view the logs for:
      1) Web
      2) Space
      3) API
      4) Worker
      5) Beat-Worker
      6) Migrator
      7) Proxy
      8) Redis
      9) Postgres
      10) Minio
      0) Back to Main Menu

   Service: 
   ```

3. Pick the service whose logs you’d like to check. For example, if you want to view the **API logs**, type `3`.

   After selecting a service, you’ll see the logs in real-time. Here’s an example of what API logs might look like:

   ```
