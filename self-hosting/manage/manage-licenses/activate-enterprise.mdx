Enterprise plan licenses are activated at the instance level through God Mode, not through individual workspace settings. This gives instance administrators centralized control over Enterprise features across all workspaces.

## Activate license key

1. Sign in to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses) with the email address you used to purchase your Enterprise plan.
2. Navigate to **Manage licenses**.
3. Copy the license key for your Enterprise plan.
4. Sign in to your Plane instance in [God Mode](/self-hosting/govern/instance-admin).
5. Select **Billing** from the left pane.
6. Paste your license key in the **Activate Enterprise license** field.
7. Click **Activate**.
