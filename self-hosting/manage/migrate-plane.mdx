title: Move your Plane instance to a new server • Commercial Edition
sidebarTitle: Move to another server
---

Switching to another machine is straightforward on the Commercial Edition. 

## Prerequisites
Before we dive in, ensure:

- You’re running Plane's Commercial Edition.
- You have a different machine with our standard config to migrate to.
- You understand the same domain will be used to host the app as the current machine.

<Warning>
If you need to change your domain during migration, contact our support team for assistance.
</Warning>

## Steps
1. **Delink licenses**  
Log in to Plane on your current server. Head to each paid workspace like One or Pro and [delink the licenses](https://docs.plane.so/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan#delink-license-key). This will free up the licenses for activation on your new server. Ideally, you have just one paid workspace.

2. **Backup data**  
Create a backup of your Plane instance with ↓:
    ```bash
    prime-cli backup
    ```
    This command will generate a backup file in the path: `/opt/plane/backups`.

3. **Set up Plane on the new server**  
Follow the [installation guide](/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose#install-plane) to deploy Plane on the new instance.

4. **Transfer backup files**  
Copy the `backups` folder from the old server, created in step 2, to the new server. Place the backup in the folder `/opt/plane`.

5. **Restore data**  
On the new server, restore your data with ↓:
    ```bash
    prime-cli restore
    ````
    Follow the prompts during the restore process to make sure everything is set up correctly.

6. **Reactivate license**  
Finally, [reactivate your license keys](https://docs.plane.so/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan#self-hosted-only) on the new instance.

This should get your Plane instance up and running on the new server.
