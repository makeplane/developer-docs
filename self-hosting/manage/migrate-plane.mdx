Here's a straightforward guide to help you migrate your Plane data from one machine to another. 

## Prerequisites
Before we dive in, ensure:

- You’re running Plane's Commercial Edition.
- The migration will be done on a different server (not on the same machine).
- The new server uses the same domain as the current server.

## Migration steps
1. **Delink licenses**  
Log into Plane on your current server. Head to each Pro/One workspace and [delink the licenses](https://docs.plane.so/workspaces-and-users/upgrade-plan#delink-license-key). This will free up the licenses for activation on your new server.

2. **Backup data**  
Create a backup of your Plane instance by running:
    ```bash
    prime-cli backup
    ```
    This command will generate a backup file in the path: `/opt/plane/backup`.

3. **Set up Plane on the new server**  
Follow the [installation guide](/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose#install-plane) to deploy Plane on the new instance.

4. **Transfer backup files**  
Copy the backup folder from the old server (created in step 2) to the new server. Place the backup in `/opt/plane`.

5. **Restore data**  
On the new server, restore your data by running:
    ```bash
    prime-cli restore
    ````
    Follow the prompts during the restore process to make sure everything is set up correctly.

6. **Reactivate license**  
Finally, reactivate your workspaces with the license keys you delinked in step 1.

And that’s it! This should get your Plane instance up and running on the new server.
