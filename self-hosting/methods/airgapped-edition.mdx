This guide walks you through setting up the Commercial Airgapped Edition in an offline environment using our pre-packaged installation bundle.

<Warning>
**IMPORTANT**  
These instructions are for new installations only. If you're migrating from an existing Community Edition to an air-gapped setup, follow [this guide](/self-hosting/manage/community-to-airgapped).
</Warning>

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure your air-gapped machine has:

- Docker (version 24 or later) up and running
- Docker Compose Plugin installed (you should be able to run docker compose or docker-compose)
- The Plane air-gapped package (`airgapped.tar.gz`) that we'll provide, which includes:
    - Docker image files (`.tar` format)
    - Configuration files (`docker-compose.yml` and `plane.env`)
    - Installation script (`install.sh`)

## Install Plane
1. Reach out to support@plane.so to get your installation download URL and the license file.

2. On a machine that has internet access, download the installation package:

    ```bash
    curl -LO <asset-download-url>
    ```

3. Transfer the `airgapped.tar.gz` file to your offline machine using whatever method works in your environment.

4. Once you have the file on your air-gapped machine, extract the package.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p airgapped
    tar -xvzf airgapped.tar.gz -C airgapped
    cd airgapped
    ```

5. Run the installation script:
    ```bash
    bash install.sh
    ```

    The script will guide you through the process. Here's what to expect:

    The installer will ask you a few questions:
        ```bash
        **********************************************************
        You are about to install/upgrade Plane as airgapped setup

        Pre-requisites:
        - Docker installed and running
        - Docker version 24 or higher
        - docker-compose or docker compose installed
        - A tarball of all the images
        - A docker-compose.yml file (docker-compose.yml)
        - A plane.env file (plane.env)
        **********************************************************

        Enter the directory to install Plane (default: /home/ubuntu/planeairgapped):

        Enter the domain or ip address to access Plane (default: 127.0.0.1): plane.mycompany.com

        **********************************************************
        Verify the final configuration:
        - Setup Directory: /home/ubuntu/planeairgapped
        - App Domain: plane.mycompany.com
        - Installation Type: New
        **********************************************************
        ```

    Once you confirm your settings, the installer will:
        - Copy the `docker-compose.yml` and `plane.env` files to your chosen installation directory.
        - Create the necessary folders for data and logs.
        - Load all the Docker images into your local Docker registry.
        - Show you the next steps to get Plane running

    You'll see something like this when the installation completes:
        ```bash
        **********************************************************
        Plane Setup is ready to configure and start

        Use below commands to configure and start Plane

        Switch to the setup directory
            cd /home/ubuntu/planeairgapped

        Start the services
            docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file plane.env up -d

        Check logs of migrator service and wait for it to finish using below command
            docker compose logs -f migrator

        Check logs of api service and wait for it to start using below command
            docker compose logs -f api

        Once the api service is started, you can access Plane at http://plane.mycompany.com

        **********************************************************
        Installation completed successfully

        You can access Plane at http://plane.mycompany.com
        ```

    After installation, your directory structure will look like this:
    ```bash
    ~/planeairgapped/
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── plane.env
    ├── data/
    └── logs/
    ```
<Tip>
Once everything is working, you can safely delete the `airgapped` folder that contains the installation script and image files to free up space.
</Tip>

## Start Plane
1. To get Plane up and running, navigate to your installation directory and start the services:
    ```bash
    cd ~/planeairgapped
    docker compose --env-file plane.env up -d
    ```

2. Watch the logs to make sure everything starts properly:
    - Monitor the database migration process:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f migrator
    ```

    - Monitor the API service startup:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f api
    ```

Once both services are running smoothly, you can access Plane by opening your browser and going to the domain or IP address you configured during installation.

## Activate your license

Once your air-gapped installation is running, you'll need to activate your workspace with the provided license file.
<Note>
You should have received the `license_key.json` file as part of your air-gapped package. If you don't have this file, contact our support team.
</Note>

1. Go to your **Workspace Settings** in the Plane application.
2. Select **Billing and plans** on the right pane.
3. Click the **Activate this workspace** button.
    ![Upload license file](/images/activate-license/upload-license-file.webp)
4. Upload the license file `license_key.json` to activate your workspace.
