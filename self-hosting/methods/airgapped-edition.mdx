<Note>
**IMPORTANT**  
Airgapped deployments are available exclusively for Business plan customers. Contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@plane.so) for pricing and licensing information.
</Note>

This guide walks you through deploying Plane Commercial in an airgapped Docker environment using Docker Compose and pre-configured images from your private registry.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Docker (version 24 or later) installed and running
- Docker Compose Plugin installed (you should be able to run `docker compose` or `docker-compose`)
- Access to a private Docker registry containing Plane images
- Required ports opened to access the application (80, 443)

<Warning>
While Docker can run stateful services with persistent volumes, we strongly recommend using external managed services for better reliability in backup/restore operations and disaster recovery.

Consider these alternatives:
- **MinIO**: Replace with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or any S3-compatible service
- **Redis**: Replace with Valkey or a managed Redis service
- **PostgreSQL**: Use a managed PostgreSQL service
- **RabbitMQ**: Use a managed message queue service
- **OpenSearch**: Use a managed OpenSearch or Elasticsearch service
</Warning>

## Install Plane

1. **Contact sales for license**

    Get in touch with sales@plane.so to get your license file and access to the Plane artifact registry.

2. **Prepare Docker images for airgapped environment**  

    Refer to [this document](/self-hosting/methods/clone-docker-images) to download the Docker images from the Plane artifact registry to your internal registry.

    <Note>
    **Important**  
    This process will NOT download or clone these infrastructure images:
    - `valkey/valkey:7.2.11-alpine`
    - `postgres:15.7-alpine`
    - `rabbitmq:3.13.6-management-alpine`
    - `minio/minio:latest`
    - `minio/mc:latest`
    - `opensearchproject/opensearch:3.3.2`

    If you're using local infrastructure services, you'll need to pull and transfer these images separately.
    </Note>

3. **Download Docker Compose configuration**

    Download the Docker Compose configuration files from the official release.

    ```bash
    # Download docker-compose.yml
    curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/releases/<plane-version>/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml

    # Download environment template
    curl -fsSL https://prime.plane.so/releases/<plane-version>/variables.env -o plane.env
    ```

4. **Configure environment variables**

    Edit the `plane.env` file to configure your deployment:

    ```bash
    # Generate a unique machine signature
    export MACHINE_SIGNATURE=$(uuidgen)

    # Set your domain
    export DOMAIN_NAME=plane.yourcompany.com
    export WEB_URL=https://plane.yourcompany.com
    export CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://plane.yourcompany.com
    ```

    **Update image references** in `docker-compose.yml` to point to your private registry:

    ```yaml
    services:
      web:
        image: your-registry.io/plane/web-commercial:${APP_RELEASE_VERSION}
      
      api:
        image: your-registry.io/plane/backend-commercial:${APP_RELEASE_VERSION}
      
      space:
        image: your-registry.io/plane/space-commercial:${APP_RELEASE_VERSION}
      
      admin:
        image: your-registry.io/plane/admin-commercial:${APP_RELEASE_VERSION}
      
      live:
        image: your-registry.io/plane/live-commercial:${APP_RELEASE_VERSION}
      
      monitor:
        image: your-registry.io/plane/monitor-commercial:${APP_RELEASE_VERSION}
      
      silo:
        image: your-registry.io/plane/silo-commercial:${APP_RELEASE_VERSION}
    ```

    **Infrastructure services** (if using local setup):
    ```yaml
    services:
      redis:
        image: valkey/valkey:7.2.11-alpine
      
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15.7-alpine
      
      rabbitmq:
        image: rabbitmq:3.13.6-management-alpine
      
      minio:
        image: minio/minio:latest
    ```

## Start Plane

1. Start the services:
    ```bash
    docker compose --env-file plane.env up -d
    ```

2. Watch the logs to make sure everything starts properly.
    - To monitor the database migration process:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f migrator
    ```

    - To monitor the API service startup:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f api
    ```

    The API is healthy when you see: `api-1   listening at`

Once all services are running smoothly, you can access Plane by opening your browser and going to the domain you configured.

## Activate your license

Once your air-gapped installation is running, you'll need to activate your workspace with the license file.

1. Login to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses) with the same email address you used to purchase the paid plan.
2. Go to [Manage licenses](https://prime.plane.so/licenses).
3. Click **Download license** to download the license file for your Plane version.
    ![Download license file](/images/activate-license/download-license.webp)
4. Navigate to the [Workspace Settings](https://docs.plane.so/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#workspace-settings) in the Plane application.
5. Select **Billing and plans** on the right pane.
6. Click the **Activate this workspace** button.
    ![Upload license file](/images/activate-license/upload-airgapped-license-file.webp)
7. Upload the license file to activate your workspace.

You now have Plane running in your air-gapped environment. If you run into any issues, check the logs using the commands above, or reach out to our support team for assistance.

## Additional configuration

For more advanced Plane configuration options, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose).
