This guide walks you through setting up the Commercial Airgapped Edition in an offline environment using our pre-packaged installation bundle.

<Warning>
**IMPORTANT**  
These instructions are for new installations only. If you're migrating from an existing Community Edition to an air-gapped setup, follow [this guide](/self-hosting/manage/community-to-airgapped).
</Warning>

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure your air-gapped machine has:

- Docker (version 24 or later) up and running
- Docker Compose Plugin installed (you should be able to run `docker compose` or `docker-compose`)
- The Plane air-gapped package we provide includes:
    - Docker image files (`.tar` format)
    - Configuration files (`docker-compose.yml` and `plane.env`)
    - Installation script (`install.sh`)

### Required files

- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration for service orchestration
- `plane.env` - Default configuration file containing environment variables
- `admin-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for admin service
- `backend-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for api/worker/beat-worker/migrator service
- `email-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for email service
- `live-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for live service
- `monitor-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for monitor service
- `proxy-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for plane-proxy service
- `silo-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for silo service
- `space-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for space service
- `web-commercial-<version>.tar` - Docker image for web service
- `minio-latest.tar` - Docker image for plane-minio service
- `postgres-15.7-alpine.tar` - Docker image for plane-db service
- `rabbitmq-3.13.6-management-alpine.tar` - Docker image for plane-mq service
- `valkey-7.2.5-alpine.tar` - Docker image for plane-redis service

## Install Plane
1. Get in touch with sales@plane.so to get your installation download URL and the license file.

2. On a machine that has internet access, download the installation package:

    ```bash
    curl -LO <asset-download-url>
    ```
    
    The download may take 15 minutes. Once the file is downloaded you no longer need internet access.  

3. Transfer the `airgapped-{arch}.tar.gz` file to your air-gapped machine.

4. Once you have the file on your air-gapped machine, extract the package.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p airgapped
    tar -xvzf airgapped-amd64.tar.gz -C airgapped
    cd airgapped
    ```

    The airgapped directory contains your `plane.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `install.sh` files which are used in the following steps.  

5. Run the installation script:
    ```bash
    bash install.sh
    ```

    The script will guide you through the process step by step. Here's what to expect:

        ```bash
        **********************************************************
        You are about to install/upgrade Plane as airgapped setup

        Pre-requisites:  

        - Docker installed and running
        - Docker version 24 or higher
        - docker-compose or docker compose installed
        - A tarball of all the images
        - A docker-compose.yml file (docker-compose.yml)
        - A plane.env file (plane.env)
        **********************************************************

        Enter the directory to install Plane (default: /home/ubuntu/planeairgapped):

        Enter the domain or ip address to access Plane (default: 127.0.0.1): plane.mycompany.com

        **********************************************************
        Verify the final configuration:
        - Setup Directory: /home/ubuntu/planeairgapped
        - App Domain: plane.mycompany.com
        - Installation Type: New
        **********************************************************
        ```

    Once you confirm your settings, the installer will:
        - Copy the `docker-compose.yml` and `plane.env` files to your chosen installation directory.
        - Create the necessary folders for data and logs.
        - Load all the Docker images into your local Docker registry.

    You'll see something like this when the installation completes:
        ```bash
        **********************************************************
        Plane Setup is ready to configure and start

        Use below commands to configure and start Plane
        Switch to the setup directory
            cd /home/ubuntu/planeairgapped
        Start the services
            docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file plane.env up -d
        Check logs of migrator service and wait for it to finish using below command
            docker compose logs -f migrator
        Check logs of api service and wait for it to start using below command
            docker compose logs -f api
        Once the api service is started, you can access Plane at http://plane.mycompany.com
        **********************************************************
        Installation completed successfully
        You can access Plane at http://plane.mycompany.com
        ```

    After installation, your directory structure will look like this:
    ```bash
    ~/planeairgapped/
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── plane.env
    ├── data/
    └── logs/
    ```

## Environment variables

The following key environment variables are automatically configured during installation:

- `MACHINE_SIGNATURE` - A unique UUID generated for your installation
- `DOMAIN_NAME` - The domain or IP address where Plane will be accessible
- `WEB_URL` - The full URL where Plane will be accessible (e.g., `http://your-domain`)
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Allowed origins for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

## Start Plane
1. To get Plane up and running, navigate to your installation directory and start the services:
    ```bash
    cd ~/planeairgapped
    docker compose --env-file plane.env up -d
    ```

2. Watch the logs to make sure everything starts properly.
    - To monitor the database migration process:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f migrator
    ```

    - To monitor the API service startup:
    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f api
    ```

    The api is healthy when you see`: api-1   listening at`

Once both services are running smoothly, you can access Plane by opening your browser and going to the domain or IP address you configured during installation.

## Activate your license

Once your air-gapped installation is running, you'll need to activate your workspace with the provided license file.
<Note>
You should have received the `license_key.json` file as part of your air-gapped package. If you don't have this file, contact our support team.
</Note>

1. Go to your [Workspace Settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#workspace-settings) in the Plane application.
2. Select **Billing and plans** on the right pane.
3. Click the **Activate this workspace** button.
    ![Upload license file](/images/activate-license/upload-license-file.webp)
4. Upload the license file `license_key.json` to activate your workspace.

You now have Plane running in your air-gapped environment. If you run into any issues, check the logs using the commands above, or reach out to our support team for assistance.

<Tip>
*Optional*  
Once everything is working, you can safely delete the `airgapped` folder that contains the installation script and image files to free up space.
