This guide shows you the steps to deploy a self-hosted instance of Plane using Portainer.

## Install Plane

### Prerequisites

   - A virtual or on-prem machine with atleast 2 vCPUs and 4 GB RAM
   - `x64` AKA `AMD 64` or `AArch 64` AKA `ARM 64` CPUs
   - Supported operating systems:
      - Ubuntu
      - Debian
      - CentOS
      - Amazon Linux 2 or Linux 2023

### Procedure

1. **Download the required files**  
You'll need two essential files to get started:

    - [docker-compose.yml](https://prime.plane.so/deployment/assets/docker-compose.yml) – Defines the services and dependencies required for Plane.
    - [variables.env](https://prime.plane.so/deployment/assets/variables.env) – Stores environment variables for your deployment.

2. Click **+ Add stack** on Portainer.

3. Copy and paste the contents of `docker-compose.yml` into the editor.

4. Load environment variables from the `variables.env` file.

5. **Configure environment variables**  
    Before deploying, edit the following variables:

    - `DOMAIN_NAME` – Your application's domain name.
    - `APP_RELEASE_VERSION` – The version of Plane you want to deploy.
    - `SITE_ADDRESS` – The full domain name (FQDN) of your instance.
    - `WEB_URL` – 
    - `COR_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` – 
    - `CERT_EMAIL` – Email address for SSL certificate generation (only needed if you're setting up HTTPS).
    - `MACHINE_SIGNATURE` – A unique identifier for your machine. You can generate this with:
        ```sh
        openssl rand -hex 16
        ```
        or
        ```sh
        uuidgen
        ```

6. Click **Deploy the stack**.

That's it! Once the deployment is complete, Plane should be up and running on your configured domain.
