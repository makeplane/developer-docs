Plane collects anonymized data to enhance your user experience, ensure product stability, and drive continuous improvements. This article talks about what we collect, what we don't, and how we use collected data.

## What Plane collects

With the exception of the instance admin's email address on self-hosted Plane, we don't collect any personally identifiable information (PII). All usage data is anonymized and isn't connected to individual users.

### Instance admin details
Plane collects just the instance admin's name and email to communicate essential upgrade news, security alerts, and other critical notifications.

### Instance setup
When an instance is created, Plane collects just the instance ID so we can track upgrades and troubleshoot paid features.

### Usage for billing
Plane tracks the number of workspaces, members, and roles to bill you correctly and ensure accurate reporting in your workspace's **Billing and plans** screen and the Prime portal.

### Application data
Plane tracks anonymized workspace activity, including but not limited to the number of projects, issues, cycles, modules, comments, issue types, custom properties, timesheet downloads, active importers, and integrations. This data helps us understand product usage, adoption, and build new features.

### User interaction and behavior
Plane collects anonymized data for how you work with Plane when creating, updating, or deleting Plane entities, including but not restricted to projects, issues, cycles, modules, and others. This data helps us understand user journeys, pain points, and overall behavior.

### Performance data
Plane collects machine configurations, environment details, OS flavors, network throughput, and stack traces to help troubleshoot and prevent performance hiccups.

Understanding how you interact with Plane helps us prioritize future developments and focus on high-impact features and improvements that drive better outcomes. 

## Disable telemetry
As much as we'd love to understand your usage better, we agree that you should be in control of your data. If for any reason you don't want to send us that data, you can turn telemetry collection off in three clicks.

1. Go to your instance's God Mode by appending `/god-mode` to the domain you have hosted Plane on.
2. In the **General Settings** pane on the right, disable the **Telemetry** toggle button.

3. Click **Save changes**.
