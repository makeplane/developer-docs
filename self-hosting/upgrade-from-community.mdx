sidebarTitle: Upgrade to Commercial Edition
---
The Commercial edition comes with the free plan and the flexibility to upgrade to a paid plan at any point.

<Warning> 
 Follow the instructions below first all the way to the end of the section **Restore data**.  
 We strongly recommend you install on a fresh machine, not the one running Plane Community.

 The instructions provided on this page are specific to installations using Docker. If you are running Plane on Kubernetes, you'll need to manually create a database dump and back up your file storage by copying the relevant volumes or storage paths.
</Warning>

<Tip>
The `/opt` folder requires sudo or root privileges. Be sure to log in as the root user or as a user with sudo access.

## Back up data

`setup.sh` in the Community Edition now comes with an option to back up your data.

1. Use  `./setup.sh` to open the operator menu and select `7` to backup your Plane data.
2. When done, your data will be backed up to the folder shown on the screen.
e.g., `/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240522-1027`
3. This folder will contain 3 `tar.gz` files.
    - `pgdata.tar.gz`
    - `redisdata.tar.gz`
    - `uploads.tar.gz`
4. Copy all the 3 files from the server running the Community Edition to any folder on the server running Plane One on any folder of your choice._createMdxContent

e.g., `~/ce-backup`

## Restore data
1. Start any command-line interface like Terminal and go into the folder with the back-up files.
    ```
    cd ~/ce-backup
    ```
2. Copy and paste the script below on Terminal and hit Enter.
    ```
    
    TARGET_DIR=/opt/plane/data
    sudo mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR
    for FILE in *.tar.gz; do
        if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
            tar -xzvf "$FILE" -C "$TARGET_DIR"
        else
            echo "No .tar.gz files found in the current directory."
            exit 1
        fi
    done

    mv $TARGET_DIR/pgdata/ $TARGET_DIR/db
    mv $TARGET_DIR/redisdata/ $TARGET_DIR/redis
    mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR/minio
    mv $TARGET_DIR/uploads/ $TARGET_DIR/minio/uploads/
    ```
3. This script will extract your Community Edition data and restore it to /opt/plane/data.
4. Install **Commercial** edition.
