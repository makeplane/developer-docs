title: Upgrade from Community to Commercial Edition
sidebarTitle: Upgrade to Commercial Edition
---
The Commercial edition comes with the free plan and the flexibility to upgrade to a paid plan at any point.

<Warning> 
**IMPORTANT**  

Make sure you already have Commercial Edition installed on a fresh machine before starting this migration. If you haven’t installed it yet, follow our [Commercial Edition](/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose#recommended-edition) installation guide first.

The instructions provided on this page are specific to installations using Docker. If you are running Plane on Kubernetes, you'll need to manually create a database dump and back up your file storage by copying the relevant volumes or storage paths.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites
- Install the [Commercial Edition](/self-hosting/methods/docker-compose#recommended-edition) on a fresh machine, not the one running the Plane Community Edition.
- Be sure to log in as the root user or as a user with sudo access. The `/opt` folder requires sudo or root privileges.

## Back up data on Community instance
1. Download the latest version of `setup.sh`.
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/makeplane/plane/releases/latest/download/setup.sh -o setup.sh
    ```

2. Run the setup.sh backup script to take the backup of the Community Edition instance.
    ```bash 
    ./setup.sh backup
    ```
3. When done, your data will be backed up to the folder shown on the screen.
    e.g., `/plane-selfhost/plane-app/backup/20240522-1027`
     This folder will contain 3 `tar.gz` files.
    - `pgdata.tar.gz`
    - `redisdata.tar.gz`
    - `uploads.tar.gz`

4. Copy all the three files from the server running the Community Edition to any folder on the server running the Commercial Edition.

    e.g., `~/ce-backup`

## Restore data on Commercial instance
1. Start any command-line interface like Terminal and go into the folder with the back-up files.
    ```
    cd ~/ce-backup
    ```
2. Copy and paste the script below on Terminal and hit Enter.
    ```
    TARGET_DIR=/opt/plane/data
    sudo mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR
    for FILE in *.tar.gz; do
        if [ -e "$FILE" ]; then
            tar -xzvf "$FILE" -C "$TARGET_DIR"
        else
            echo "No .tar.gz files found in the current directory."
            exit 1
        fi
    done

    mv $TARGET_DIR/pgdata/ $TARGET_DIR/db
    mv $TARGET_DIR/redisdata/ $TARGET_DIR/redis
    mkdir -p $TARGET_DIR/minio
    mv $TARGET_DIR/uploads/ $TARGET_DIR/minio/uploads/
    ```
3. This script will extract your Community Edition data and restore it to `/opt/plane/data`.
