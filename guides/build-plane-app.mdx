description: Step-by-step development guide to build and integrate an app with Plane using OAuth-based authentication and authorization workflow.
---

<Note>Plane apps are currently in **Beta**. Please send any feedback to support@plane.so.</Note>

## Introduction
Plane apps seamlessly integrate tools and services with Plane so you can
use them without ever leaving your Workspace. Apps are conveniently available
from our [marketplace](https://plane.so/marketplace/integrations), helping you
stay focused and productive.

## Why Build a Plane App?

**Stop doing manual work.**
Plane integrations eliminate repetitive tasks like copying updates between
tools, creating work items from support tickets, and generating status reports.
Instead of spending hours on administrative work, let your app handle it
automatically.

**Connect everything you already use.**
Your team probably uses dozens of different tools. Plane apps create a unified
workflow by connecting your favorite CRM, time tracking app, CI/CD pipelines,
communication tools, and more, together into Plane. One change in Plane can
trigger updates across your entire tech stack.

**Build exactly what you need.**
Unlike rigid SaaS platforms, Plane's open core nature means you can create
integrations that fit your specific workflow.

## Prerequisites

- A [Plane](https://app.plane.so) workspace
- Admin access to your workspace settings
- Familiarity with OAuth 2.0 concepts (authorization code flow)
- A backend server to handle OAuth token exchange

## High-Level Workflow

1. [Register your app on Plane developer portal](/guides/build-plane-app/#registering-your-app)
2. [Implement OAuth flow](/guides/build-plane-app#implement-oauth-flow)
3. [Obtain and store access tokens securely](/guides/build-plane-app#obtain-and-store-access-tokens-securely)
4. [Make authenticated API requests to Plane](/guides/build-plane-app#make-authenticated-api-requests-to-plane)
5. [Handle token refresh](/guides/build-plane-app#handle-token-refresh)

## Registering Your App

To build an OAuth application with Plane:

1. Navigate to `https://app.plane.so/<workspace_slug>/settings/applications/`.
2. Click on the **Build your own** button.
3. Fill out the form with the required details:

   - **Redirect URIs**: Provide the URIs where Plane will send the authorization code.
   - **Setup URL(Optional)**: Provide the URL that users will be redirected to when they click "Install App" from the marketplace. This URL should initiate the OAuth flow for your application.
   - **Contact Details**: Add your email or other contact information.
   - **Webhook URL Endpoint(Optional)**: Your service's webhook endpoint. Plane will send an HTTP `POST` request to this endpoint upon every change to the workspace in which your app was installed.
   - **Organization Details(Optional)**: Optionally include your contact email, privacy policy URL, terms of service URL, and any other relevant information. This helps Plane validate and approve your application should you choose to [list in the marketplace](#listing-your-app-on-plane-marketplace).

4. If you're building an agent (with or without using Plane's ADK) capable of performing operations when assigned or mentioned, enable the **Is Mentionable** checkbox during app creation.
5. Once the app is created, securely store the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You will need these credentials to interact with Plane's API during the OAuth flow and for making authenticated API requests.

## Implement OAuth Flow

### Generating Consent URL (Optional)

This step is optional. This is needed only if the app should be installed from outside Plane's environment, the developer needs to generate the consent URL using the client ID generated during their app creation flow.

If this flow needs to be triggered from Plane marketplace as well, then provide the URL in "Setup URL" field on application create screen to redirect the user from marketplace on clicking "Install App" button.

Below are sample implementations:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
import os
from urllib.parse import urlencode

params = {
    "client_id": os.getenv("PLANE_CLIENT_ID"),
    "response_type": "code",
    "redirect_uri": os.getenv("PLANE_REDIRECT_URI"),
    # Optional: include state if needed
}

consent_url = f"https://api.plane.so/auth/o/authorize-app/?{urlencode(params)}"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { URLSearchParams } from 'url';

const params = new URLSearchParams({
  client_id: process.env.PLANE_CLIENT_ID!,
  response_type: "code",
  redirect_uri: process.env.PLANE_REDIRECT_URI!,
  // Optional: include state if needed
});

const consentUrl = `https://api.plane.so/auth/o/authorize-app/?${params.toString()}`;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

There are two types of authenticated actions your application can perform:

1. **User-authorized actions**: Actions performed on behalf of a user after they grant permission to your app via OAuth.
2. **App-authorized actions**: Actions that the app can perform independently within the workspace where it is installed (such as responding to webhooks or automation triggers).

We will describe how to configure and use each type in the following sections.

### App-Authorized Actions (Client Credentials Flow)

When the app is installed, Plane will send an `app_installation_id` as part of the callback to the `redirect_uri` provided during consent URL generation. You can use this `app_installation_id` to request a bot token for your app.

#### Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
import base64
import requests

# Prepare basic auth header using client_id and client_secret
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
basic_auth = base64.b64encode(f"{client_id}:{client_secret}".encode()).decode()

# Prepare request data
payload = {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "app_installation_id": app_installation_id
}

# Make a POST request to fetch bot token
response = requests.post(
    url="https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Basic {basic_auth}",
             "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    data=payload
)

# Parse the response
response_data = response.json()
bot_token = response_data['access_token']
expires_in = response_data["expires_in"]
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

// Prepare basic auth header using client_id and client_secret
const clientId = "your_client_id";
const clientSecret = "your_client_secret";
const basicAuth = Buffer.from(`${clientId}:${clientSecret}`).toString('base64');

// Prepare request data
const payload = {
  grant_type: "client_credentials",
  app_installation_id: appInstallationId
};

// Make a POST request to fetch bot token
const response = await axios.post(
  "https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
  payload,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Basic ${basicAuth}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
  }
);

// Parse the response
const responseData = response.data;
const botToken = responseData.access_token;
const expiresIn = responseData.expires_in;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### User-Authorized Actions (Authorization Code Flow)

In this flow, your app exchanges the `code` received as a query parameter on the callback (to your `redirect_uri`) for an access token and refresh token. The access token is short-lived and must be refreshed using the refresh token when it expires. Both tokens should be securely stored.

#### Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
import requests

# Exchange authorization code for access and refresh tokens
code = "authorization_code_from_callback"
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"
redirect_uri = "your_redirect_uri"

payload = {
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "code": code,
    "client_id": client_id,
    "client_secret": client_secret,
    "redirect_uri": redirect_uri
}

response = requests.post(
    url="https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    data=payload
)

# Parse the response
response_data = response.json()
access_token = response_data["access_token"]
refresh_token = response_data["refresh_token"]
expires_in = response_data["expires_in"]
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

// Exchange authorization code for access and refresh tokens
const code = "authorization_code_from_callback";
const clientId = "your_client_id";
const clientSecret = "your_client_secret";
const redirectUri = "your_redirect_uri";

const payload = {
  grant_type: "authorization_code",
  code: code,
  client_id: clientId,
  client_secret: clientSecret,
  redirect_uri: redirectUri
};

const response = await axios.post(
  "https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
  payload,
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
  }
);

// Parse the response
const responseData = response.data;
const accessToken = responseData.access_token;
const refreshToken = responseData.refresh_token;
const expiresIn = responseData.expires_in;
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Fetching App Installation Details

In both user-authorized and app-authorized flows, the `app_installation_id` identifies the app's installation within a specific workspace. It is recommended that developers fetch workspace details after OAuth is successfully completed. Plane provides an `app-installation` endpoint that works with both types of tokens.

#### Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
import requests

# Set authorization header with either access token or bot token
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
}

# Make GET request to fetch installation/workspace details
response = requests.get(
    url=f"https://api.plane.so/auth/o/app-installation/?id={app_installation_id}",
    headers=headers
)

workspace_details = response.data[0]
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';

// Set authorization header with either access token or bot token
const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
};

// Make GET request to fetch installation/workspace details
const response = await axios.get(
  `https://api.plane.so/auth/o/app-installation/?id=${app_installation_id}`,
  { headers }
);

const workspaceDetails = response.data[0];
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Sample Response

```



## Obtain and store access tokens securely

Once you have obtained the access token, you can use it to make authenticated API requests to Plane.
Store the access token and refresh token securely in your database.


## Make authenticated API requests to Plane

For making authenticated API requests to Plane, you can use the access token obtained from the OAuth flow.

API reference is available at [https://docs.plane.so/api-reference](https://docs.plane.so/api-reference).

We have official SDKs for the following languages to simplify the OAuth flow and make it easier to call Plane's API.

| Language | Package Link | Source Code |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Node.js | [npm i @makeplane/plane-node-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@makeplane/plane-node-sdk) | [plane-node-sdk](https://github.com/makeplane/plane-node-sdk) |
| Python | [pip install plane-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/plane-sdk/) | [plane-python-sdk](https://github.com/makeplane/plane-python-sdk) |

## Handle Token Refresh

When the access token expires, you can use the refresh token to get a new access token.


#### Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">

```python
# When access token expires, use refresh token to get a new access token
refresh_payload = {
    "grant_type": "refresh_token",
    "refresh_token": refresh_token,
    "client_id": client_id,
    "client_secret": client_secret
}

refresh_response = requests.post(
    url="https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
    data=refresh_payload
)

# Parse the refresh response
refresh_response_data = refresh_response.json()
access_token = refresh_response_data["access_token"]
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">

```typescript
// When access token expires, use refresh token to get a new access token
const refreshPayload = {
  grant_type: "refresh_token",
  refresh_token: refreshToken,
  client_id: clientId,
  client_secret: clientSecret
};

const refreshResponse = await axios.post(
  "https://api.plane.so/auth/o/token/",
  refreshPayload,
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    }
  }
);

// Parse the refresh response
const refreshResponseData = refreshResponse.data;
const accessToken = refreshResponseData.access_token;
```
